Side friction factors used in high-speed and low-speed design were determined using vehicle occupant comfort as the selection criterion.  This criterion assumes that drivers limit their speed on curves to ensure comfort, and that discomfort is directly related to the unbalanced side-friction.  Several concerns or issues accompany these assumptions.  For example, the speed at which discomfort (or side pitch) first becomes noticeable may be slower than necessary for comfort or safety and the level of discomfort felt by a driver may not be solely related to side friction.  These assumptions also do not directly consider vehicle characteristics or constant safety factors over the range of design speeds. Transition length determination for high-speed and intersection design is based on appearance and comfort. The criterion was developed to avoid an appearance that results from too rapid a change in superelevation.  For low-speed design, a change in acceleration over the change in time factor, known as C, is used to determine superelevation runoff.  High-speed design includes factors that are to be used to determine runoff lengths for roads with more than two lanes.  Low-speed design does not include similar factors to adjust for wider pavements; however, it does include a method for adjusting runoff length for radii larger than minimum that the high-speed design procedure does not include.","description":"This report reviews the history of horizontal curve design procedures through published policies from 1940 to 1990.

Though an average of only 10% to 15% of all approach traffic turns left, these vehicles are involved in approximately 45% of all accidents.  This report presents the results of research conducted to develop models which estimate approach accident rates at high speed signalized intersections. The objective of the research was to quantify the relationship between traffic and intersection characteristics, and accident potential of different left turn treatments.  Geometric, turning movement counts, and traffic signal phasing data were collected at 100 intersections in Iowa using a questionnaire sent to municipalities.  Not all questionnaires resulted in complete data and ultimately complete data were derived for 63 intersections providing a database of 248 approaches.  Accident data for the same approaches were obtained from the Iowa Department of Transportation Accident Location and Analysis System (ALAS).  Regression models were developed for two different dependent variables:  1) the ratio of the number of left turn accidents per approach to million left turning vehicles per approach, and 2) the ratio of accidents per approach to million traffic movements per approach.  A number of regression models were developed for both dependent variables. One model using each dependent variable was developed for intersections with low, medium, and high left turning traffic volumes.  As expected, the research indicates that protected left turn phasing has a lower accident potential than protected/permitted or permitted phasing.  Left turn lanes and multiple lane approaches are beneficial for reducing accident rates, while raised medians increase the likelihood of accidents.  Signals that are part of a signal system tend to have lower accident rates than isolated signals.  The resulting regression models may be used to determine the likely impact of various left turn treatments on intersection accident rates. When designing an intersection approach, a traffic engineer may use the models to estimate the accident rate reduction as a result of improved lane configurations and left turn treatments. The safety benefits may then be compared to any costs associated with operational effects to the intersection (i.e., increased delay) to determine the benefits and costs of making intersection safety improvements.","description":"The study investigates the impact of left-turn treatments on safety at high-speed signalized intersections.

Interim Report","abstract":"The traditional approach to reduce accidents at intersections has been to install traffic control devices.  However, it has not been established that installation of such devices as signals, signs, or pavement markings, substantially improves pedestrian safety.  On the contrary, empirical investigations have indicated that these devices tend to create a false sense of security.  The major criteria used in installing these devices are vehicular volumes, pedestrian volumes, and engineering judgment.  The compliance with these devices is, however, dependent on the pedestrian behavior.  It is therefore necessary to study the crossing behavior, not only to realize the full benefits of signalization, but also to develop and evaluate new strategies to deal with the pedestrians.  This report focuses on the crossing behavior of pedestrians at traffic signalized intersections.  Since a non-compliant pedestrian attempting to cross on a \"don't walk\" phase looks for gaps in the traffic stream, the gap-acceptance theory is used to model the crossing maneuver.  An inconsistent behavior model is assumed wherein the critical gap is treated as a random quantity varying both within and across individuals.  Four possible crossing modes are identified, but only two could be studied because of sample size restrictions.  Group interactions are incorporated in the models, as the behavior of individual pedestrians within the group may not be independent.  Also, the pedestrians within the group may not be independent.  Moreover, the pedestrian push-button choice behavior is integrated with the gap-acceptance models, as these two behaviors are correlated.  Models are developed in the framework of random utility maximization theory using a multinomial probit approach. A data collection methodology was developed using a stratified sampling approach, with land use as the exogenous variable.  The procedure was applied to selected intersections from the city of Austin, Texas.  On-site surveys were conducted to obtain information on the behavior using a video recording technique. The calibration package used applies the Monte Carlo simulation technique to compute the choice probabilities, and obtains maximum likelihood estimates for the model parameters.","description":"This report focuses on pedestrian crossing behavior at signalized intersections.

A trade-off analysis of detector placement is, therefore, essential for optimization of dilemma zone protection and reducing delays. TEXAS Model (Version 3.2) was employed to determine optimal detector placement strategies on high speed isolated intersections.  Traffic volumes varied between 200 vehicles per hour (vph) per approach to 800 vph per approach.  Mean speeds of 90 km/h (55 mph), 70 km/h (45 mph), and 55 km/h (35 mph) were simulated.  Detector placements were developed for mean as well as for 85th percentile speeds.  At approach volumes less than 500 vph per approach (250 vphpl), three detector layouts with the first or innermost detector located between 0 m (0 ft) to 18 m (60 ft) from the stop line, resulted in lower delay, whereas at traffic volumes greater than 500 vph per approach (250 vphpl), three detector layouts, with the first detector between 24 m (80 ft) and 36 m (120 ft) from the stop line, resulted in lower delay.  This trend exists for detector layouts for both mean and 85th percentile speed.  Statistical analysis shows that there was no significant difference in delays for detector layouts with the first detector between 0 m (0 ft) to 18 m (60 ft) from the stop line within that group. Detector layouts with the first detector placed between 24 m (80 ft) to 36 m (120 ft) from the stop line had no significant difference in delays within this group.  Regression analysis performed on delay and cycle length for different detector layouts showed a strong linear relationship between them.

The study evaluated SVROR accidents over an 8-year period, 1987-1994.  Statistical analyses of the pre- and post-treatment accident data indicated that SVROR accidents do occur on certain highway control sections at a rate suggestive of a potential problem.  Control sections can be evaluated for degree of SVROR problem potential by computing z scores for that particular highway control section and evaluating if the value exceeds 85% of the values of all other control sections over a period of several years. Highway control sections exhibiting a value above the 0.85 z score can be identified in the majority of those Texas control sections that received shoulder mitigation during the period 1989-1994; treated sections were not constructed prior to 1989. Two factors were found to influence the z score and evaluation of a control section:  very short highway control sections with SVROR accidents tend to inflate the z score and highway control sections with very high ADT and SVROR accidents tend to deflate the z score.  Discounting single years of unusually large numbers of SVROR accidents in a control section, comparative analyses of treated highway control sections and adjacent non-treated comparable highway control sections without treatments demonstrated a significant reduction in SVROR accidents as a result of some type of shoulder treatment. Analysis did not definitively identify particular types of shoulder treatments as being more effective than others. However, depressed grooves formed by milling are recommended as the best treatment in sections constructed in PCC and HMAC pavements, particularly in snow-removal regions.  Rolled-in grooves, using bars welded to a steel wheel roller, are recommended as the alternative to milled-in grooves.  One hundred-mm diameter non-reflectorized traffic buttons placed at 1.5 m intervals parallel to and offset 150 to 300 mm from the driving lane edge line are recommended for \"chip-and-seal\" type of shoulder paving or in other situations where milled or depressed grooves are not feasible.","description":"This study aimed to monitor the effectiveness of shoulder treatments in reducing single-vehicle run-off-the-road (SVROR) accidents on rural, multi-lane highways in Texas.

Eight existing, two under construction and one approved for construction freeway sections have been studied on a before-, during-, and after-construction basis.  The sections selected for study range from being in predominately residential suburban areas to predominantly commercial-industrial downtown areas. The specific effects of the three types estimated for each study section are as follows:  (1) social impacts: population changes, neighborhood accessibility, neighborhood cohesion and community services; (2) economic impacts: relocation and mitigation costs, business sales, property uses and values, tax revenues, employment and income and user costs; and (3) environmental impacts: aesthetics, drainage and erosion, noise and air pollution, vibration and hazardous spills.  The literature review and a survey of highway agencies in other states were used to determine the appropriate procedures or models and mitigation measures to implement in estimating the social, economic and environmental impacts of elevated and depressed freeways.  The results of the study, presented in six separate reports according to types of effect, can be used by highway planning and designing engineers to prepare environmental statements and documents of the expected social, economic and environmental impacts of proposed elevated and depressed freeway projects.  Also, the results can be disseminated at the public hearings for a proposed project.  This report presents the findings of the drainage, erosion, hazardous spill, vibration and aesthetic effects of elevated, depressed and at-grade level freeways.

Days of the week were grouped together into three groups for each model and all possible scenarios were investigated to produce the best statistical fit truck trip production/attraction models.  Preliminary analyses of various sources of data revealed that manually recorded gate pass cards, maintained by the Port of Miami, were the most accurate and detailed source of truck movements at the port. More than 73,000 cards were entered into the University of Central Florida database for a total of 57 days of gate pass data.  These data were used to calibrate and validate truck trip generation models.  Additionally, forecasting models for the number of imported/exported trailers/containers at the port were developed using two different approaches:  time series and regression analysis.

The experiments took place on the Borman Expressway, in Gary, Indiana and on I-65, south of Lafayette, Indiana.  Concurrently, two speed-readings were acquired from the passing vehicles in the vicinity of the air monitoring system using a hand-held laser gun.  The speeds were integrated to determine the speeds and accelerations of the passing vehicles at the spectrometer.  An 8-mm camcorder was used to videotape the passing vehicles in order to determine the vehicle types.  Three vehicle types were determined:  type I represented all the automobiles, type II represented all the medium-duty vehicles including light and medium duty trucks, pick-ups, and vans, and type III represented all the heavy-duty vehicles, mainly semi-trailers. Meteorological data were also recorded from the nearest surface weather stations.  Overall, 16,870 vehicles were monitored, of which 8,478 were type I, 4,829 were type II, and 3,563 were type III.  The flow rates in count per minute were 8.92 for type I, 5.08 for type II, 3.75 for type III, and 17.75 for the combined fleet.  However, 4,413 vehicles were retained for data analysis. These included 2,848 (65%) type I vehicles and 1,565 (35%) type II vehicles.  Type III vehicles were not included in the analysis because their exhaust emission concentrations were not measured. However, their counts and frequencies were determined.  The analysis for the PVEMP database showed that the exhaust emission concentrations were very variable with a logarithmic distribution.  On average, type I vehicles exhaust emission concentrations were 1.10% CO and 0.23% HCs while that of type II vehicles were 1.16% CO and 0.24% HCs.  They were 1.12% CO and 0.23% HCs for the combined fleet.  The recorded vehicle speeds varied from 34.5 mph (55.5 kph) to 83.5 mph (134.4 kph) with a mean of 56.56 mph (91.01 kph).  Accelerations varied from -4.5 mph/sec (-7.4 kph/sec) to +4 mph/sec (+6.4 kph/sec) with a mean of 0.17 mph/sec (0.27 kph/sec).  With a high emitter cut-point set at 4.0% CO and 0.2% HCs, 5.7% and 49.2% of the combined vehicle fleet were CO and HCs high emitters, respectively.  The instantaneous values of the exhaust CO and HCs emission concentrations exhibited a nonlinear relationship with vehicle speeds and accelerations.  Using the PVEMP database, a real-time modal exhaust emission concentration model was developed.  The model was based on the nonlinear multivariate regression of the speed-acceleration matrix for modal-average CO and HCs exhaust emission concentrations aggregated by vehicle type.

The work conducted under this contract can be divided into three major areas:  (1) development of equipment necessary for the testing program, (2) performance of the tests, and (3) analysis of the test results.  The three main pieces of equipment used in this study were a road simulator, a two-axle truck, and a wheel force transducer.  The road simulator was not operational when the project began, and a major effort was devoted to first make the simulator operational and then to improve its performance to the level dictated by the research objectives of this study.  A new wheel force transducer was designed, fabricated, and tested.  It was demonstrated that the transducer provides a reliable and accurate tool for measuring dynamic tire forces generated by heavy trucks.  The tests involving the two-axle truck were conducted on the road simulator, on three road sites in Virginia, and on an instrumented test road section.  In addition, three tire types, including two popular dual tire types and a wide-base single tire, were tested.  The test variables in the road simulator experiments included suspension type (steel leaf spring and air bag), tire type, vehicle speed, road roughness, axle static load, and tire inflation pressure.  The air suspension generated lower dynamic loads in tests conducted on low- to medium-roughness roads at low to medium speeds.  There were no benefits from using air suspension when the vehicle was traveling at higher speeds on high roughness roads.  The differences between dynamic loads produced by the three tire types were relatively small.  Furthermore, it was found that the dynamic tire forces were strongly affected by vehicle speed and road roughness and moderately affected by axle static loads.

Data included a variety of engineering measures including video of the driver and the road scene.  One objective of the study was the identification of periods of drowsiness and inattention, documented on video, that would be made available for public education and outreach programs.  A second objective was to validate, in a naturalistic driving setting, the drowsy driver detection algorithms developed by Wierwille, et al. in a simulator environment.  Participants' personal vehicles were instrumented with the MicroDAS instrumentation system and all driving during the data collection was fully discretionary and independent of study objectives.  The study thus offered the opportunity to implement highly unobtrusive data collection in subjects' own vehicles with the absence of an experimenter in an effort to gather naturalistic data with a minimum of experimental artifacts.  Results highlight the importance of lanekeeping variation as a key predictor variable for detecting drowsiness while driving, although the drowsy detection algorithm did not perform as well as in the simulator studies. An attempt to relate algorithm results to the prediction of driver inattention was inconclusive.  The results are discussed in terms of theoretical and procedural issues associated with inattention, drowsiness and driver responses to false positive epochs.  It is suggested that the use of a multiplicity of approaches for addressing drowsy and inattentive driving would be most effective, and recommendations are made for future research on both technological and behavioral interventions.","description":"This study aimed to assess algorithms for detecting drowsy and inattentive drivers on the road.

A Differential Global Positioning System (GPS) senses the vehicle's position and velocity.  This method seems to offer adequate precision with a low-enough infrastructure cost to make the system practical in most rural settings. Researchers used a heavy vehicle -- a class 8 truck tractor -- partly because of the most favorable economics associated with installation of this type of system on a commercial vehicle, and partly because of the commercial driver's higher exposure to conditions that engender drowsy driving.  This research examines two potential applications of the steering, throttle, and brake controllers.  The first, a virtual rumble strip, vibrates the wheel whenever the vehicle drifts out of its lane.  The second, a system that monitors driver steering performance, senses the erratic steering that presages loss of consciousness and then takes control of the vehicle, pulling it over to a safe stop.","description":"The report details the creation of a system that can safely steer a vehicle when its driver becomes incapacitated.

The Office of Transportation Technologies, Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies (OIT OHVT) has an active program to develop the technology for advanced LE-55 diesel engines with 55% efficiency and low emissions levels of 2.0 g/bhp-h NOX and 0.05 g/bhp-h particulate. The goal is also for the LE-55 engine to run on natural gas with efficiency approaching that of diesel fuel. The LE-55 program is being completed in FY 1997 and, after approximately 10 years of effort, has largely met the program goals of 55% efficiency and low emissions. However, the commercialization of the LE-55 technology requires more durable materials than those that have been used to demonstrate the goals. Heavy Vehicle Propulsion System Materials will, in concert with the heavy duty diesel engine companies, develop the durable materials required to commercialize the LE-55 technologies. OIT OHVT also recognizes a significant opportunity for reduction in petroleum consumption by dieselization of pickup trucks, vans, and sport utility vehicles. Application of the diesel engine to class 1,2, and 3 trucks is expected to yield a 35% increase in fuel economy per vehicle. The foremost barrier to diesel use in this market is emission control. Once an engine is made certifiable, subsequent challenges will be in cost; noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH); and performance. The design of advanced components for high-efficiency diesel engines has, in some cases, pushed the performance envelope for materials of construction past the point of reliable operation. Higher mechanical and tribological stresses and higher temperatures of advanced designs limit the engine designer; advanced materials allow the design of components that may operate reliably at higher stresses and temperatures, thus enabling more efficient engine designs. Advanced materials also offer the opportunity to improve the emissions, NVH, and performance of diesel engines for pickup trucks, vans, and sport utility vehicles. The principal areas of research are: (1) Cost Effective High Performance Materials and Processing; (2) Advanced Manufacturing Technology; (3)Testing and Characterization; and (4) Materials and Testing Standards.","description":"The Heavy Vehicle Propulsion System Materials Program aims to develop materials for advanced diesel engines that can improve fuel economy and reduce emissions.

The bus traveled off the right side of the roadway into an emergency parking area, where it struck the back of a parked tractor-semitrailer, which was pushed forward and struck the left side of another parked tractor-semitrailer.  Of the 23 people on board the bus, the driver and six passengers were killed; the other 16 passengers were injured.  The two occupants of the first tractor-semitrailer were injured, and the occupant of the second tractor-semitrailer was uninjured.  The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the probable cause of this accident was the bus driver's reduced alertness resulting from ingesting a sedating antihistamine and from his fatigued condition resulting from Greyhound scheduling irregular work-rest periods.  Contributing to the severity of the accident was the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission's practice of routinely permitting nonemergency parking in pull-off areas within the highway clear zone.  The major safety issues identified in this accident were the bus driver's performance, the adequacy of carrier oversight, the adequacy of the design and the appropriateness of the use of pull-off areas, the lack of motorcoach emergency interior lighting and retroreflective signage, and the organization of the disaster preparedness and emergency response management.

The bus, carrying 43 passengers, was en route from La Place, Louisiana, to a casino approximately 80 miles away in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi.  As the bus approached milepost 1.6, it departed the right side of the highway, crossed the shoulder, and went onto the grassy side slope alongside the shoulder.  The bus continued on the side slope, struck the terminal end of a guardrail, traveled through a chain-link fence, vaulted over a paved golf cart path, collided with the far side of a dirt embankment, and then bounced and slid forward upright to its final resting position.  Twenty-two passengers were killed, the bus driver and 15 passengers received serious injuries, and 5 passengers received minor injuries.

The Minnesota Department of Transportation sponsored the project.  Researchers used the flat-screen simulator at the University of Minnesota Human Factors Research Laboratory to conduct experiments.  They measured vehicle speed, braking, and acceleration/deceleration during simulated driving and visually observed stopping behavior. In addition, they analyzed responses to a post-test questionnaire.  They created a 11.3-mile simulated driving environment with 10 signalized intersections and configured four experimental models: low speed limit (SL) of 50 miles per hour with no AWFs, low SL with AWF at each intersection, high SL of 65 miles per hour with no AWFs, and high SL with AWF at each intersection.  Researchers set different vehicle-signal proximity intervals, with all green/ no yellow as the control, and zero seconds with the vehicle adjacent to the signal, two seconds, three-and-a-half seconds, or five seconds.  With each model, they assigned two intersections each proximity interval, with the sequence of intersection proximity intervals ordered differently for each model.  Each of 24 subjects completed duplicate driving trials with each model.  The study revealed that, relative to intersections with no AWFs, drivers who encountered yellow signals at AWFs intersections: stopped more frequently at low SLs but not at high SLs, drove more slowly while approaching intersections with two and three-and-a-half second proximity intervals, and displayed less inconsistent behavior at intersections with short proximity intervals. Researchers concluded that AWFs assist drivers with decision-making behavior and promote safer driving behavior.

The speed limit was 65 mph, with an advisory speed limit of 55 mph on the curves. The driver recovered the vehicle from the fishtail. When the motorcoach fishtailed at MP 272.3, the transmission retarder was engaged despite icy road conditions.  Following this fishtail, the driver shifted into neutral, thereby disengaging both the transmission retarder and eliminating any retarding torque provided by the transmission. Approximately 36 seconds later, as the motorcoach gained speed as it descended the mountain, the driver lost control of the vehicle on a curve. As the motorcoach continued to descend the roadway, the driver lightly applied the service brakes several times.  The motorcoach drifted off the right side of the road, returned to the road, rotated, and departed the north side of the roadway backward. The vehicle rolled down a 40-foot-deep embankment and came to rest on its roof.  The driver and 2 passengers were killed; 33 passengers sustained serious injuries and 24 sustained minor injuries. The accident driver appeared to be safe and conscientious, with no signs of fatigue, substance abuse or serious medical condition that would affect performance. Although the bus driver had received little training on transmission retarders, he had substantial experience driving motorcoaches. No serious mechanical problems with the motorcoach were found.  The Safety Board could not determine why the driver had the retarder engaged during icy roadway conditions, why he shifted the transmission into neutral after the fishtail, and why he chose not to apply the brakes more vigorously prior to the accident.  The Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the motorcoach driver's inability to control his vehicle under the icy conditions of the roadway; the driver initiated the accident sequence by inappropriately deciding to use the retarder under icy conditions. As a result of this accident, the National Transportation Safety Board recommends that a booklet be developed and disseminated to educate motorcoach drivers on the use of retarders during low-friction-coefficient road conditions. It is also recommended that standards for brake and transmission electronic control units should be developed that require those units to store a full history of time-stamped electronic fault codes.","description":"A 59‑passenger motorcoach traveling on State Highway 50 west of Canon City, Colorado, experienced a fishtail at 9:05 p.m. on December 21, 1999 while negotiating a curve on a 7‑mile downgrade.

The school bus traveled off the roadway at a 3- to 4-degree angle, hit a metal delineator, struck a corrugated metal drainage culvert, and rotated counterclockwise about its vertical axis on the east roadside. The bus reentered onto the pavement, continued rotating across the travel lanes, and overturned 180 degrees about its longitudinal axis. The bus continued rotating about its vertical axis; before coming to rest, the bus rolled back onto its right side.  A mechanical inspection on scene showed that the steering, suspension, and tires were well maintained and the brakes were properly adjusted. During the rollover sequence, a 5-year-old student was fatally injured. The medical examiner determined that the victim sustained massive head trauma resulting from ejection through the front roof hatch opening. The busdriver and the other 46 students sustained minor injuries. The forward and rear roof emergency hatches were sheared off along the hinge line; the hatch openings remained intact. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of this accident was the school bus driver's failure to control the school bus after the bus driver had been distracted by one of the passengers.","description":"On November 30, 2000, a school bus traveling north at 53 mph on State Highway 117 near Herndon, Kentucky, ran off the road and overturned.

The monetary gains/losses in contractual procedures such as lane rental and incentive/disincentive depend on the queuing analysis.  The statewide survey indicated that incentive/disincentive and lane rental procedures were more effective in reducing duration of work zones and delay.  The survey of state DOTs indicated that for estimating capacity the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) technique was used; for estimating queue length and delay, QUEWZ, QuickZone, and HCM technique were used; and for estimating road user costs, QUEWZ and spreadsheets were used more often than other techniques.  About 57% of the DOTs said they use Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technologies in work zones.  Headway and traffic flow data were collected and analyzed for 14 work zones in Illinois.  Field data were compared to the results from FRESIM, QUEWZ, and QuickZone software.  QUEWZ overestimated the capacity and average speed, but underestimated the average queue length. Speeds computed in FRESIM were comparable to the average speeds from the field data when there was no queuing at the work zones. However, when there was queuing, FRESIM overestimated the speed.  The queue lengths obtained from FRESIM were shorter than the field values in half of the cases and longer in the other half of the cases.  The queue lengths from QuickZone did not match the field data and generally QuickZone underestimated the queue lengths.  QuickZone consistently underestimated the total delay observed in the field.  When demand is less than capacity QuickZone does not return any user delay because it does not consider the delay due to slower speeds in the work zones.  A new methodology was developed to determine capacity, speed reduction, delay, queue length, and user costs.  Speed reductions due to the work zone factors are used to compute operating speed.  Then, capacity is determined using speed flow curves developed in this study.

Thus, ODOT has done construction and maintenance work at night in order to minimize the disruption of daytime traffic.  However, nighttime operations produce a new set of concerns such as safety, public relations, productivity, and quality.  Decision-making for using nighttime operations in Oregon has been subjective and has relied on judgment without the benefit of analytical data and evaluation criteria.  Therefore, a decision model that facilitates the determination of when to use nighttime road construction and maintenance work was developed.  From the literature review, 19 factors affecting decision-making were identified and used to create a survey.  The investigators surveyed ODOT personnel, ODOT's contractors, and the representative personnel from other departments of transportation.  After analyses of various perspectives, the overall result was fairly consistent with the results from the individual respondent groups.  The results provided the ability to eliminate unimportant factors, determine weights of important factors, and build a decision model to improve the effectiveness of decision-making.  The decision model was tested by applying it to actual ODOT projects and comparing its recommendations on when to conduct the projects with actual decision makers' decisions.  The overall testing results were consistent with current decision makers' subjective decisions because of the impact of congestion within the decision model.

However, enforcement of these regulations is not practical.  Furthermore, difficulty in making this crossing maneuver discourages use of transit.  The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) and New Jersey Transit Corporation (NJ TRANSIT) recognize that solutions to alleviate this situation are few and that alternatives such as pedestrian overpasses are not feasible due to the relatively large expense.  Therefore, NJDOT and NJ TRANSIT have initiated a project to investigate solutions that would benefit pedestrians and encourage mass transit ridership.  Several measures are available for signalized intersections.  However, unsignalized intersections and mid block crossings pose significantly more challenges in terms of safely accommodating pedestrian safety and mobility. The time critical need to access a bus stop location poses an additional challenge.  In order to properly develop criteria for identifying specific location deficiencies, the New Jersey Institute of Technology Project Team proposes a human centered approach for evaluating an array of creative solutions to address pedestrian crossing and access to bus stops along state highways.  As the NJDOT maintains the state highway system, it is imperative that the potential solutions are acceptable to the NJDOT.

The inability to perform either option successfully is attributed to the existence of dilemma zones (DZs).  DZs often form at high-speed signalized intersections and occur when an intersection is hidden or occurs after a long gap.  One way to avoid DZs is to advocate stopping at the intersection through Advance Warning Signals (AWSs).  This study evaluates the effectiveness of AWS devices in providing DZ protection to drivers at two intersections in Utah: one in Brigham City and the other in St. George.  The AWS in Brigham City also was reinforced with advance detection (AD) technology.  The Utah Traffic Lab compared the intersections with AWS to an intersection without AWS.  Findings showed that the AWS in St. George was not effective in reducing the number of drivers in DZs.  Although 90% of drivers responded positively by reducing their speed when the signal was flashing, most of them reserved their decision to stop or proceed until they were close to the intersection.  St. George had 1.15 percent more vehicles in the DZ than the control intersection.  In contrast, the AWS setup at Brigham City was effective in reducing vehicles in the DZ. There were 1.4% fewer vehicles in the DZ than at the control intersection.  The combined AWS-AD setup in Brigham City may have contributed to this effectiveness.  Because the study did not yield conclusive results on the effectiveness of AWS systems, it is recommended that a detailed study be conducted at potential AWS locations before any future installations.","description":"This study evaluates the effectiveness of Advance Warning Signals (AWS) in reducing dilemma zones at high-speed signalized intersections.

The motorcoach, carrying 14 passengers, was en route from Shreveport, Louisiana, to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, as part of a multicity sightseeing tour that had originated in Eldorado. As the motorcoach approached milepost 168, it drifted rightward from the travel lanes and onto the shoulder, where it struck the rear of a 1988 Peterbilt tractor semitrailer operated by Alpha Trucking, Inc., which was stopped on the shoulder at milepost 167.9. As both vehicles moved forward, the motorcoach rotated clockwise slightly and the semitrailer rotated counter-clockwise slightly; the vehicles remained together.

Left turn egress movements from driveways or side streets are replaced by turning right onto the major road and then making U-turns at downstream median openings or signalized intersections.  One of the public concerns regarding this treatment is that drivers making a right-turn followed by a U-turn (RTUT) could experience much longer delay and travel time than those who would otherwise make a direct left turn (DLT).  This study analyzed the operational effects of this widely used access management treatment.  Data were collected on eight selected street segments in the Tampa Bay area in Florida.

In addition to information from control devices, drivers gather information from surrounding traffic streams, highway geometry, the vehicle itself, and many off-road visual information sources. Driving on urban freeways demands a high level of driver attention to many, sometimes competing, information sources, and the driver must quickly filter these data—interpreting that which is important—and continually prepare for the next elements in the information stream. Drivers have finite abilities to receive, filter, and process information per time unit, and if the information flow reaches or exceeds typical human limits, driver stress levels may increase and important bits of information may be missed completely or misinterpreted. Relationships between information flow, driver stress, driver performance and accident experience have been hypothesized. This study classifies urban freeways in Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio, Texas, regarding the intensity of information flow or information load presented to drivers. Crash statistics for 1999, 2000, and 2001 are compared to information load rates and significant correlations are identified. Test drivers experience each of the twenty-seven information load levels identified for the freeways in the three Texas cities as they negotiate selected driving routes. A portable data acquisition system records the driver’s field of view, vehicle trajectory data, driver electro-cardiogram, and eye movements as the drivers experience the real world information flow situations. Correlations between driver stress level, characterized by heart rate or electrocardiogram wave form and information load, are identified. Thresholds for minimum and maximum desirable numbers of traffic control signs per unit distance are developed for freeways having two, three or four, and five or more lanes per direction. A methodology for classifying urban freeways regarding information loads presented to drivers is described.","description":"This study investigates the relationship between driver responses and urban freeway information loads.

Vehicle-actuated control, combined with multiple advance detectors, is often used to improve operations and safety.  However, this type of detection and control has not always resulted in a significant number of crashes.  Crashes sometimes continue to occur at high-speed intersections, and delays to traffic movements can be unnecessarily long.

As the transition is made between the 1-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) and the 8-hour NAAQS, critical questions arise about the effectiveness of potential new mobile source control strategies for reducing 8-hour averaged ozone concentrations in Texas non-attainment areas. This project had two primary objectives. The first objective was to examine the relative effectiveness of potential new emission control measures, primarily from mobile sources, on 1-hour and 8-hour ozone concentrations and population exposure metrics in the Houston and Dallas areas. The second objective was to conduct a pilot-scale study to examine how portable emissions monitoring system (PEMS) technology can be used to characterize exhaust emissions from heavy-duty diesel vehicles and equipment during real-world driving conditions. The overall goal of the research was to provide a foundation for effective transportation and air quality policy decisions in eastern Texas. A total of 38 modeling simulations were conducted to examine a range of emission control strategies. This modeling indicated that even with reductions in on-road and non-road mobile source emissions greater than 40%, at least one monitor in each area is still predicted to remain in non-attainment. Given these challenges, it is recommended that the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) continue to investigate eligibility for Texas Emission Reduction Program (TERP) funding to reduce NOx emissions from on-road heavy-duty diesel vehicles and non-road equipment (particularly diesel construction equipment) and continue to pursue effective emission control strategies that can be adopted both locally and statewide to assist in obtaining regional NOx reductions. The pilot-scale PEMS study demonstrated the successful deployment of the Sensors, Inc. SEMTECH-D PEMS on single-axle and tandem-axle dump trucks during typical TxDOT operations. Idling accounted for the most significant fraction (20%–46%) of the duty cycle and had the highest average and median fuel-specific emission factors for all pollutants. TxDOT should continue to examine the idling practices of its dump trucks with respect to the impacts on both emissions and fuel consumption. Differences in emissions between non-idling modes of operation varied by pollutant. CO2 and NOx emissions were reasonably consistent between non-idling modes; CO and THC emissions exhibited greater variability with differences of a factor of two, or three in some cases. The range of NOx emission factors measured in this study showed very good agreement with emission factors measured through chassis dynamometer testing of the same engine types by Baker et al., (2004), and were well within the range of values reported in other studies. TxDOT should continue to characterize baseline emissions from other on-road and non-road equipment besides dump trucks during typical operations, as well as examine the effectiveness of new fuels and fuel additives and new after-market emission reduction technologies that will be emerging from TERP, the New Technology Research and Development (NTRD) Program, and similar state or national-scale incentive programs.","description":"This study evaluates emission control strategies for the 8-hour ozone standard in the Houston and Dallas areas.

The first issue concerns the ductility of prestressed concrete girders in these bridges because the section that is typically used may be considered to be over-reinforced according to AASHTO LRFD Bridge Specifications. Response of the section, including neutral axis location, strand stress at ultimate capacity, and moment capacity, predicted by AASHTO Standard and AASHTO LRFD Specifications are compared with the sectional response determined from nonlinear strain compatibility analyses. Modifications are proposed to the AASHTO LRFD procedure to rectify the errors in predicting sectional response. The second issue that was investigated concerns the strength and stability of prestressed concrete through-girder pedestrian bridges when subjected to impact by over-height vehicles. Three-dimensional finite element models of entire bridges and subassemblages were used to evaluate the strength, stiffness, and ductility characteristics of the bridge system and connection details. Accurate representation of the bridge details in the finite element models were assured by utilizing experimentally determined load-deformation characteristics for the connections.

During the 2006 construction season, the DLLMS was implemented on three freeway segments in southern Michigan. Each work zone segment involved a lane closure from two to one lane. Based on the travel time characteristics, queue, merge locations, and throughput, the effectiveness of the DLLMS was evaluated by the Wayne State University Transportation Research Group. Before period data were not available, so a conventional work zone merge system located on EB I-94 was used as a control site for the WB I-94 test site. Since the two I-69 test sites are approximately 150 miles away from the EB I-94 control site, the I-94 control site could not be used as a control for the I-69 sites. When comparing the I-94 control and test sites, the presence of the DLLMS improved the flow of traffic and increased the percentage of merging vehicles that merged at the taper.","description":"The study examines the Dynamic Late Lane Merge System (DLLMS) in freeway work zones where lane closures cause irregular merging and traffic disruptions.

The results of binary and ordinal logistic models showed that fatal and high injury collisions were strongly and significantly associated with (1) a pedestrian crossing at an unsignalized intersection (versus crossing at all other locations or walking along the roadway); (2) the vehicle moving straight ahead on the roadway (versus all other types of vehicle actions). There was a lack of association between injury severity and collision frequency, suggesting that safety programs intended to reduce the number of collisions and those intended to reduce the risk of severe injury and death should use different approaches. The latter should focus on individual factors such as driver or pedestrian actions and behaviors, as well as on road environment factors such as speed limits and intersection signalization.

Quite often, these “detour” lanes are narrower requiring motorists to exert additional caution to avoid collision with the dividers. During nighttime driving, it is frequently difficult to determine lane narrowing or shifts. If an active delineation light could be attached to the top of the jersey barriers, drivers could know, with fair warning, where and how the road changes. The research developed two types of barrier lighting devices using light illuminating diodes (LED) and Electroluminescent (EL) technology that employ solar power as the energy source. The lamps have been designed to withstand the harsh environment of the highway, have small footprints and lightweight, portable, and require no wires or outside power source. The light is bright enough to see at a distance without distracting the driver, and the unit is highly power efficient and designed to be practically maintenance free. The lamps can run for almost a week with 2-3 days of full charge. This is especially attractive for winter and cloud cover days. A drive test survey was carried out in October 2006 to evaluate motorists’ perception of the lighting system with the help of Dr. John Faucett, Professor of Psychology at the university. Approximately 100 students and their friends and relatives took part in the drive test. The survey indicated that 74% of respondents believed the LED lighting would be more effective for marking highway barriers and changes in the roadway than the passive reflectors, and 71% of respondents felt that the EL lighting would be more effective than reflectors. The respondents favored the LED lighting system for its brightness although the EL system is known to be more effective in foggy and misty environment. Such a weather condition was not present during drive test. The barrier lights are commercially viable and ready for technology transfer. It is believed that the deployment of the lamps on jersey barriers will vastly improve driver safety. Being portable, the lamps are also suitable for other highway applications including road construction site and sharp bend on highway exits.","description":"The research developed two types of barrier lighting devices using light illuminating diodes (LED) and Electroluminescent (EL) technology that employ solar power as the energy source.

Consequently, these trucks can have a significant impact on traffic operations. It is therefore essential to properly account for this impact in the traffic operations analysis in order to reflect operational quality of the roadway as accurately as possible. Signalized intersections are one roadway facility that can be particularly sensitive to the presence of commercial truck traffic. The most common methods used for the analysis of signalized intersections is contained in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). In this method, the base saturation flow rate of the signalized intersection is defined in units of passenger cars per hour green lane (pc/hg/In). To account for the presence of large trucks in the traffic stream, the HCM includes Passenger Car Equivalency (PCE) value. In the current edition of the HCM, a PCE value of 2.0 is applied to all large trucks, with no distinction between different size of trucks. Some transportation professionals have questioned the validity of this PCE value recommended by the HCM. They are concerned that the impact of trucks at signalized intersections is being under-estimated. If this is the case, then capacity is being over-estimated and intersections are not being adequately designed. The primary objective of this research was to determine appropriate truck PCE values to apply for signalized intersection analysis. These PCE values were classified by three different categories of truck size and performances. Additionally, a general PCE value with only one truck category was developed for planning purposes and/or a less detailed analysis. The development of the PCE values was based on the relative headway concept, as defined in the HCM. The results of this study are based primarily on data generated from a custom simulation program. However, a considerable amount of field data was collected for the purpose of simulation calibration. The PCE values determined from this study are 1.8, 2.2, and 2.8 for small trucks, medium trucks, and large trucks, respectively. Additionally, and equation was developed to calculate start-up lost time that accounts for the impact of trucks at the front of the queue, as opposed to standard 2.0 seconds recommended by the HCM. Furthermore, based on the field data collected, it was found that the base saturation flow rate value of 1900 pc/hg/ln recommended by the HCM appears to be quite optimistic.","description":"The study investigates the impact of large trucks on arterial LOS and freeway work zone capacity.

Trucks also have a disproportionate impact on roadway capacity.  Depending on the context, a large truck can consume the equivalent of several cars worth of roadway capacity due to the physical size, the acceleration and other performance characteristics.  The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), the world's leading source for highway capacity and level of service determinations, provides a constant passenger car equivalent (PCE) factor of 1.5 cars for each heavy vehicle on a freeway and 2.0 cars for an arterial.

Witnesses following the motorcoach prior to the accident estimated that it had been traveling about 70 mph. At the exit 23A interchange, the motorcoach veered to the right and entered the grassy area between the exit ramp and the entrance ramp. As it rotated in a clockwise direction, the motorcoach struck an exit sign, overturning onto its left side and sliding in a southwesterly direction. The left side of the vehicle struck the westernmost side of a 2-foot-deep earthen drainage ditch, and the motorcoach continued to roll over. As it rolled, the roof opened up, allowing passengers to be thrown from the open top. The motorcoach landed 65 feet from the drainage ditch and came to rest upside down. Its roof was laying on the ground (top side up), still hinged to the right side of the vehicle. At the time of the accident, it was dark and there was no highway safety lighting. The roadway was wet from a misting rain, but there was no standing water. The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the motorcoach driver’s fatigued condition, which led him to drift from the left side of the roadway, contact rumble strips, oversteer to the right, and then move off the roadway. The detachment of the motorcoach roof was a contributing cause to the severity of injuries and the number of ejections.","description":"On October 9, 2004, a 1988 Motor Coach Industries motorcoach carrying 29 passengers was traveling southbound on Interstate 55 near Turrell, Arkansas.

The coach veered right, entered the grassy area between the exit and entrance ramps, and struck an exit sign. It overturned onto its left side, slid southwest, and struck a 2‑foot‑deep earthen drainage ditch. The vehicle rolled, its roof opened, and passengers were ejected from the open top. The coach landed 65 feet from the ditch, upside down, with the roof still hinged to the right side. The incident occurred in darkness, without highway lighting, on a wet but not standing‑water roadway.","objective":"The investigation aimed to determine the sequence of events leading to the motorcoach run‑off‑the‑road and rollover. It sought to identify the primary causes of the vehicle’s loss of control and the contributing factors that increased injury severity.

Pilots are also required to report any administrative action resulting in denial, suspension, cancellation, or revocation of driving privileges or mandatory attendance at an educational or rehabilitation program. The purpose of this study was to evaluate fatal civil aviation accidents between the years 2000 and 2007 in which ethanol was present in the pilot, and the pilot had previously documented drug and/or alcohol offenses and/or dependence. Toxicological and aeromedical findings from pilots were collected for an 8-year period, 2000 - 2007. Case histories, accident information, and the probable cause of the accidents were obtained from the National Transportation Safety Board. Toxicological information was obtained from the Civil Aerospace Medical Institute’s Forensic Toxicology Research Laboratory. During the examined time period, 215 pilots (9%) of the 2,391 received for analysis had documented alcohol- or drug-related offenses. Of the 215 pilots, 23 (11%) had consumed ethanol prior to the fatal incident. Of these 23 pilots, 16 (~70%) had ethanol concentrations above the FAA’s legal limit of 40 mg/dL and 7 (~30%) between 20 and 40 mg/dL. Providing more detailed documentation to aviation medical examiners would aid in the determination of eligibility for medical certification and could potentially save pilots as well as their passengers’ lives.

The warning system uses sensors to detect vehicles that are unlikely to stop at red traffic signals and uses signs and flashing lights to warn drivers who might collide with a violator. Several human factors issues need to be addressed before such a system could be deployed. The experiments for this study addressed one of these issues--whether, if warned, a sufficient number of drivers would respond in a way that would allow them to avoid a right-angle collision.

The highway routes being used to haul these commodities were identified, and statistically selected samples were used in the analysis. Approximately 270 control sections on Louisiana highways that carry sugarcane are involved in the transport of this commodity. Three different gross vehicle weight (GVW) scenarios were selected for this study including: 80,000 lb, 100,000 lb and 120,000 lb. The maximum current allowable GVW is 80,000 lb, while the maximum 100,000 lb GVW is the permitted load for sugarcane trucks and is currently the highest load level permitted by Louisiana laws. The methodology for analyzing the effect of these loads on pavements was taken from the 1986 AASHTO Design Guide and involves determining the overlay thickness required to carry traffic from each GVW scenario for the overlay design period. Differences in the life of an overlay were calculated for different GVW scenarios and overlay thickness and costs were determined for a 20 year analysis period. These costs were developed for samples taken from all the control sections included in the study. These net present worth costs from the samples were expanded to represent the cost for all control sections carrying sugarcane. Results indicate that the damage from each sugarcane truck with a GVW of 100,000 lb to pavement overlay is at about $2,072/year and to bridge fatigue cost is at about $3,500/year. Therefore, the current sugarcane trucks permit fee of $100 per year is not adequate and should be increased to recover these costs. The legislature should not consider raising the GVW level to 120,000 lb because the pavement overlay costs increase by twofold (double) and the bridge repair costs become very large. Moreover, the magnitude of the damage caused by the 120,000 lb GVW for a FHWA Type 9 truck makes the risk of bridge damage and even bridge failure too significant to ignore. The project staff recommends that the legislature keep the GVWs at the current level but increase the permit fees sufficiently to cover the additional pavement and bridge costs or change the configuration of the axle on the trailer from a tandem to a triple, effectively changing the vehicle from a FHWA Type 9 to a Type 10 vehicle. Under these circumstances, the permit fee can be reduced to zero and a tax incentive of $683 can be given to each truck for the conversion. It is recommended to allocate more highway funding for handling the extra damage caused by the increase of truck load limits.","description":"This study evaluates the economic impact of overweight permitted vehicles hauling sugarcane on Louisiana highways.

These types of work zones usually rely on the use of flagging personnel to alternate the flow of traffic on the single open lane. Thus, the analysis of this type of work zone is quite different from that of multilane roadways. While a couple of analysis methods do exist for this type of work zone, there is no commonly accepted or nationally adopted method. The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) developed their own method, which is included in their Plans Preparation Manual (PPM). This method is fairly simple and considers a limited number of factors. Consequently, there is a very limited range of field conditions for which this method will yield reasonably accurate results. Furthermore, the only output from the method is work zone capacity. The objective of this project was to develop an analysis procedure for two-lane roadway work zones (with a lane closure) that was more robust, both in terms of inputs and outputs, than the FDOT’s current PPM method. A custom microscopic simulation program was developed to generate the data used in the development of the models contained in the new analysis procedure.

Preserving, expending, and enhancing these highways require the set-up of a large number of one-lane, two-way work zones where traffic safety has been a severe concern. Aimed at reducing the work zone crashes attributable to inattentive driving, the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) initiated a research project to evaluate the effectiveness of a traffic warning sign that is assembled by using the emergency warning flashers of the vehicles in one-lane, two-way work zones. This warning sign was named as the Emergency Flasher Traffic Control Device (EFTCD). It works in the following fashion. When a vehicle entering a one-lane, two-way work zone where stopping is required for waiting to pass the work zone, the driver is required to turn on its emergency warning flashers to warn the following vehicles of the work zone stopping condition. The EFTCD is flexible and cost-effective and may particularly benefit those work zones that are frequently moved due to the construction progress. To accurately evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed EFTCD, researchers conducted experiments in three one-lane, two-way work zones in Kansas including two with a 55-mph speed limit and one with a 65-mph speed limit. During the experimental period, researchers collected vehicle speed data with and without the EFTCD and surveyed drivers for their interpretation of this warning sign and recommendation on its potential implementation. Analyses of the results showed that the EFTCD effectively reduced the mean speeds in work zones as well as the proportions of notably high speeds. In addition, survey results indicated that the EFTCD successfully captured the attention of most drivers when they approached the work zones. A majority of drivers recommended the implementation of this warning sign in the work zones. Therefore, researchers concluded that the EFTCD was effective in one-lane, two-way work zones. Recommendations on future research were also presented based on the results of this study. The outcomes of this research project benefit not only Kansas, but also other States where rural two-lane highways constitute a high percentage of their highway systems.","description":"The study aimed to reduce work zone crashes by using vehicles' flashers as a warning sign in one-lane, two-way work zones.

After entering the curve, the motorcoach departed the right side of the roadway at a shallow angle, striking the guardrail with the right-rear wheel and lower coach body. The motorcoach traveled approximately 350 feet along the foreslope, with the right tires off the roadway. The back tires lost traction as the foreslope transitioned into the drainage ditch. The motorcoach rotated in a counterclockwise direction as it descended an embankment.

Over the last forty years, a small number of studies developed guidelines for traffic engineers to help in deciding when a left turn lane is warranted for a given situation. Building on these previous attempts, this report describes the development of a refined decision support system (DSS) for assessing the likely benefits of left-turn lane installations as an aid to deciding whether a left-turn lane is warranted. The developed DSS is designed to predict these likely benefits based on several measures including delay savings, reductions in percent stops, increases in fuel efficiency, and reductions in emissions. The first step in developing the DSS was to use microscopic simulation to model several real-world unsignalized intersections with different geometric configurations and located in different area types. After carefully calibrating these models, several scenarios covering a wide range of operational conditions were simulated. The output from these simulation runs was then used to train a set of Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Networks (NNs), and to generalize the results from the models’ runs. The NNs were then incorporated into a DSS that can help an analyst quantify the impacts of a proposed new development as well as estimate the benefits of left-turn lane installations. The report also presents an investigation of the safety effects of exclusive left turn lane installation at unsignalized intersections. Crash prediction models were estimated using crash and volume data from intersections without left turn lanes by intersection category and crash category. Intersections throughout Connecticut were selected, representing six different types of intersections based on rural versus urban location, number of approach legs and number of through lanes on the main road. Negative binomial modeling was used with generalized estimation equations to account for the correlation among the crash counts for an intersection through the years. The expected number of crashes was predicted using the prediction models for intersections with left turn lanes assuming no left turn lanes were present. If the observed crash counts were significantly lower than the predicted, then there was evidence that the left turn lane created a safer condition. The results of comparing the observed and predicted crashes showed that the intersections were safer for same direction crashes when left turn lanes were installed, except for those on urban two lane roads, at which no safety effect is discernible.","description":"The report presents a refined decision support system (DSS) for assessing the likely benefits of left-turn lane installations at unsignalized intersections and driveways.

Previous research studies have found this type of a beam to have high efficiency and to be a potentially viable replacement for short span bridges on low traffic roadways. Since both wood and concrete exhibit time-dependent behaviors, it is necessary to examine the effects of sustained and repeated loads on the composite beam. Two lab specimens were utilized to examine these behaviors. A long-term load, estimated to be 11% of the maximum capacity, was applied to the first specimen. Due to the rheological effects of the composite beam, the final deflection of the specimen at a time period of 256 days was 1.75 in., which was more than twice the elastic deflection due to the application of the dead and live loads. In order to predict the time-dependent deflection, an existing finite element program was utilized as well as a simplified evaluation method. It was determined that, with modifications, both methods provide accurate predictions. The other specimen in the study was subjected to repeated loads up to the design service load for 35,000 cycles. It was found that the repeated loading does affect the effective stiffness of the beam as it dropped to 94.6% of the initial value as a result of the 35,000 load cycles. In addition, the time-dependent deflection of the specimens during the 28-day concrete curing period was monitored, and an empirical relationship previously developed for specimens with a different span was successfully modified to predict the deflection of specimens with various spans.","description":"This research study investigates the long-term and repeated load behavior of wood-concrete composite beams, specifically those made from recycled utility poles.

The goals of this study were to examine the differences between pedestrian and bicycle crashes in urban and rural settings in North Carolina and to identify problem areas (specific crash types and crash locations) on rural highways that are of high priority for safety treatment and treatment development.","description":"Approximately one quarter of pedestrian and bicycle fatal and injury crashes occur on rural highways nationwide. Rural highways differ from urban ones by having higher average vehicle speeds and a lack of sidewalk provisions, which can increase hazard levels for vulnerable road users. Research on rural highway crashes is limited, especially when detailed crash coding and linkage with roadway characteristics and traffic counts are employed. This study focuses on North Carolina, comparing pedestrian and bicycle crashes in urban versus rural contexts.

The U.S. Department of Transportation has instituted the Speed Management Strategic Initiative to seek more effective ways to manage the crash-related effects of speeding. In support of this initiative, this study conducted a detailed examination of recent crash data through the development of a speeding-related (SR) crash typology to help define the crash, vehicle, and driver characteristics that appear to result in a higher probability of SR crashes. Thus, the goal is to determine variables associated with SR crashes—such as what, where, when, and who—in order to provide guidance to the future development of new treatments and to more effectively target new and existing treatments. Recent Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and National Automotive Sampling System General Estimates System (NASS GES) data were used to answer these questions. Because these national databases only allow the use of a definition of SR that combines both exceeding the speed limit and too fast for conditions, two State databases (North Carolina and Ohio) were used to determine if different findings resulted from using the combined definition versus the exceeding the speed limit definition. Two analysis methodologies were used: (1) single-variable table analysis and (2) classification and regression tree (CART). In the first, for a series of both crash-related and vehicle/driver-related variables (e.g., crash type and age of driver), individual codes within each variable were examined to determine which showed an overrepresentation of SR crashes or SR vehicles/drivers (e.g., rear-end crashes for 16–19-year-old drivers). The second method involved CART analyses which automatically define which factors/variables are the most critical with regard to SR crashes or drivers and which combinations of variables/codes are the most important. Similar single-variable and CART analyses were also conducted for five high-priority subsets of the data (e.g., pedestrian crashes and intersection crashes). As might be expected, the results differed between fatal and total crashes, national and State, and among States. Few differences were seen in the results based on the two definitions. The single-variable table results were consistent with two earlier studies in indicating higher SR percentages in single-vehicle crashes, rural crashes, crashes on curves, nighttime crashes, motorcycle crashes, as well as crashes involving young drivers, male drivers, drivers not using restraints, and drivers under the influence of alcohol. No consistent pattern of speeding was seen in either pedestrian or bicycle crashes or in work zone crashes. The CART results from the different databases were less consistent and more difficult to interpret. The crash-based results consistently identified single-vehicle crashes during adverse weather as a high-priority subgroup. The vehicle-based findings indicated almost no consistency across databases, with young male showing up more than other descriptors.","description":"This study aimed to develop a speeding-related crash typology by examining recent crash data from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and National Automotive Sampling System General Estimates System (NASS GES).

In the Netherlands, a young novice driver (18‐24 years old) has a four times greater chance of being involved in a crash than older, more experienced drivers (30‐59 years old). Crash rates are highest in the first months after licensing and drop substantially over the first two years of driving, with the most pronounced decline during the first six months or during the first 5000 kilometres of driving. There are basically two factors associated with the high crash risk: young age and lack of experience. The high crash risk for young drivers may be related to the fact that the human brain is still developing during adolescence. Especially executive functions such as planning, impulse control, reasoning and the integration of information, which are relevant for safe driving, have not yet developed fully by the age of 18. In addition, specific subgroups of young drivers are even more at risk due to life‐style factors, such as intentional risk taking, sensation seeking and peer pressure, often associated with young age.","description":"This study examines the crash rates of young novice drivers in the Netherlands, comparing them to older, more experienced drivers.

The negative environmental impacts of these oscillations are widely accepted, but their impact on traffic safety has been debated. This report describes the impact of freeway traffic oscillations on traffic safety. This study employs a matched case-control design using high resolution traffic and crash data from a freeway segment. Traffic conditions prior to each crash were taken as cases, while traffic conditions during the same periods on days without crashes were taken as controls. These were also matched by presence of congestion, geometry and weather. A total of 82 cases and about 80,000 candidate controls were extracted from more than three years of data from 2004 to 2007. Conditional logistic regression models were developed based on the case-control samples. To verify consistency in the results, 20 different sets of controls were randomly extracted from the candidate pool.

There are many engine and fuel alternatives for current and prospective vehicle owners to consider that have differing effects on a vehicle’s pollutant output. In addition, new technologies, such as diesel particulate filters, auxiliary power units, and selective catalytic reduction, are being used in the production of new vehicles, and can often be installed on used vehicles, to reduce emissions and/or improve fuel economy.

In 2006, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) initiated an exploratory case series study to consider airbag performance in GA accidents. The goals of the study were (1) to examine the effectiveness of airbags in mitigating occupant injury in GA accidents, (2) to identify any unintended consequences of airbag deployments, and (3) to develop procedures to assist investigators in documenting airbag systems in future investigations. During the 3-year data collection period, researchers tracked 145 notifications of events involving airbag-equipped airplanes which yielded 10 airbag-equipped GA airplane accidents that met the study criteria and were subjected to a full review and analysis by a multidisciplinary team. There were no unexpected deployments or unintended consequences identified during the study period. When adjusted correctly, the deployment of the airbag systems did not result in any negative outcomes, and in certain cases, deployment mitigated the severity of occupant injuries. The NTSB concluded that aviation airbags can mitigate occupant injuries in severe but survivable crashes in which the principal direction of force is longitudinal. During the course of the study, the study team also became aware of several potential issues that may compromise occupant safety associated with use, adjustment, or design of restraint systems. The report discusses steps that could be taken to address these safety issues and suggests future research directions in the area of GA occupant protection. Finally, as a result of the study, guidance for NTSB investigators was developed and disseminated, including a formal process for gathering data about airbag installations and deployments in accident aircraft.","description":"The study examined the effectiveness of airbags in mitigating occupant injury in general aviation (GA) accidents.

The bike boxes, also known as advanced stop lines or advanced stop boxes, were installed to increase visibility of cyclists and reduce conflicts between motor vehicle and cyclists, particularly in potential \"right-hook\" situations. Before and after videos were analyzed for seven intersections with green bike boxes, three intersections with uncolored bike boxes, and two control intersections. User perceptions were measured through surveys of cyclists passing through five of the bike box intersections and of motorists working downtown, where the boxes were concentrated. Both the observations and survey of motorists found a high rate of compliance and understanding of the markings. Overall, 73% of the stopping motor vehicles did not encroach at all into the bike box. Both motor vehicle and bicycle encroachment in the pedestrian crosswalk fell significantly at the bike box locations compared to the control intersections. The bike boxes had mixed effects on the motorists’ encroachment in the bicycle lane. The number of observed conflicts at the bike box locations decreased, while the total number of cyclists and motor vehicles turning right increased. Negative-binomial models based upon the data predict fewer conflicts with the boxes, particularly as right-turning motor vehicle volumes increase. Observations of yielding behavior at two bike box and one control intersection found an improvement in motorists yielding to cyclists at the bike box locations. Differences in the traffic volumes and location contexts make firm conclusions about the effects of green coloring of the boxes difficult. Higher shares of surveyed motorists felt that the bike boxes made driving safer rather than more dangerous, even when the sample was narrowed to respondents who were not also cyclists.

The ability to predict these crashes would allow the agencies to develop interventions to change drivers’ behavior and ultimately reduce the number of these crashes. Teen drivers are ideally suited for this type of intervention for several reasons. They are disproportionately over-represented in crashes – teens account for only 4% of the driver population but account for 10% of crashes (Vachal and Malchose, 2009). Also, many teen crashes occur within the first year of being licensed and are the result of a lack of driving experience. Lastly, the learning curve is still steep at this point in teens’ driving history which makes them more susceptible to interventions. In an attempt to predict these crashes, North Dakota driver licensing data and crash data were used to develop a sample of 20,392 teen drivers age 14 to 17. Within the first year after being licensed, these drivers sustained 317 crashes that resulted in an injury or death. The resulting logistic regression model identifies gender, traffic convictions, rural/urban, geography, and involvement in previous property-damage-only (PDO) crashes as markers that are significant in predicting these injury and fatal crashes. According to the model, living in an urban area increases risk of being in an injury or fatal crash within the first year after attaining a license by 2.5 times compared to drivers who live in rural areas. Drivers involved in a previous PDO crash are 25 times more likely to be involved in an injury or fatal crash than those not involved in a previous PDO crash. These results can be used in a driver improvement program. One application may be an advisory or warning letter targeted to teen drivers suggesting additional training or guidance for those who exhibit the above markers. Hopefully, this letter will alter their behavior and reduce their likelihood of being involved in an injury or fatal crash.","description":"The study aims to identify factors that predict teen driver crashes, particularly those resulting in injury or fatality.

Recent events, such as the July 2006 ceiling collapse of the I-90 Central Artery/Tunnel (CA/T) in Boston, Massachusetts, have called attention to the need for such national standards. After investigating the CA/T ceiling collapse, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommended that the FHWA seek legislation to establish a mandatory tunnel inspection program that would identify critical inspection elements and specify an appropriate inspection frequency. The FHWA requested clearance from the Office of the Secretary of Transportation to proceed with regulatory action to develop National Tunnel Inspection Standards similar to the National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS) contained in the Code of Federal Regulations, 23 CFR 650, Subpart C. An Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was published in the Federal Register in November 2008.

Investigators developed and manufactured working samples of the patent-pending cell phone disabling device from the Texas A&M Health Science Center (HSC). The intention was to provide 100 of the devices to families with a newly licensed teen driver. Half of the devices were to be distributed in an urban area (Houston) and the other half in a rural area (Brenham). The 50 participating families and teenagers in each group were to be compared to 50 of their peers (newly licensed teen drivers) who did not receive and install the cell phone disabling device. In total, there were to be 200 teen drivers participating in the project with 100 participants per group: 50 with the device and 50 without the device. Following unforeseen development cost issues and dramatic changes in the target cellular phone market, the HSC device was abandoned for a commercial device already on the market. The comparison with this device was conducted using pre- and post-surveys of parents regarding driving records of teens in both the control (n = 26) and treatment (n = 72) groups. The project analyzed vehicle, crash, and moving violation data. Qualitative data were collected in the form of surveys and analyzed using statistical software. Post-surveys of parents and teens were taken at inception and 1 year after the teen entered the study. Surveys inquired about teen involvement in traffic crashes, awareness of performance decrements, attitudes toward the device, issues with usability and quality, and marketability of the device.

One of the reasons for this new policy are several incidents which occurred at these types of bridges, one of them being the ‘Ketelbrug’ between the Dutch towns of Lelystad and Emmeloord. In recent years DVS organized several expert meetings to answer the question of how the road user can be brought to a safe stop at a bridge. The initial warning system for the ‘Ketelbrug’ has already been replaced by a new, temporary system. SWOV was asked to provide knowledge for the design of this initial warning system, and was specifically asked whether initial warnings at 900, 600, or 300 metres would be more effective and safer than an initial warning at 1500 metres (as was the case in the old situation). The literature used in this small-scale study provides general knowledge. This knowledge appears to be insufficient for a specific recommendation for the actual distance at which initial warning should commence. However, indications were found to be careful with initial warning at ‘very’ close distance from the bridge On the other hand, it is also important not place the initial warning at ‘too” large a distance from the bridge. This leaves the question of what exactly the optimal distance is. Furthermore, account must be taken of the variety of other aspects that may have a role in the safest possible design of the initial warning system. Examples are uniformity, homogeneity, credibility, understandability, communication of the reason why, communication in general, gradual activation of the initial warning system or switching on the entire system in one go, habituation, getting out of the habit, and confusion. Further research into behaviour and incidents in traffic in the proximity of movable bridges is recommended. This research can be carried out both in practice and in a simulator. This will provide more clarity about a safe design of the initial warning system.

In Task 2, an observational study of pedestrian behavior in parking lots, the authors found: 1) Greater use of crosswalks by all age groups (young, middle, old) in larger parking lots, though no significant age variation occurred in using crosswalks; 2) No significant age variation was seen in lateral distance to parked cars when pedestrians were navigating; and 3) Greater distracted walking by younger than older pedestrians. In Task 3, a field experiment requiring middle-aged and older pedestrians to navigate through an open parking lot and a parking garage wearing eye-tracking equipment, the authors found: 1) Age differences in walking speeds when navigating parking lots with older pedestrians, aged 65 and older, walking about 0.6 ft slower than middle-aged adults, aged 50 to 64; and 2) No significant age differences in attention patterns when navigating parking lots, as indicated by scanning behavior (e.g., head turns, eye fixation patterns) or in response to a backing out threat (fixation response time, walking path deviation). The authors conclude that the most likely reason for the differential crash types in parking lots for older compared to younger pedestrians probably lies in the reduced speed with which older pedestrians can react to hazardous events. Potential countermeasures to improve safety could include age-targeted educational campaigns and development and deployment of collision-avoidance technology.

This study quantified the impact of overweight vehicles with heavy axle loads on bridge decks using laboratory tests and numerical simulations. The laboratory tests focused on evaluating the impact of combined mechanical stresses and freeze-thaw cycles on the durability of air-entrained concrete. Concrete cylinders, after being cured in saturated limewater for 28 days, were subjected to various levels of compressive loads and then exposed to 300 freeze-thaw (F/T) cycles. Rapid chloride ion penetrability tests were conducted to evaluate the chloride permeability of the concrete samples. The laboratory test results indicated that the mechanical loading combined with freeze-thaw cycles significantly increased the permeability of air-entrained concrete and may accelerate the deterioration of concrete elements such as bridge decks. The observed permeability increase was due to the fact that higher compressive loads caused more extensive microcracks in concrete, and the damaged concrete further degrades under freeze-thaw cycles, which may have further opened and interconnected the microcracks. Bridge deck analyses were conducted to investigate stress distributions and stress levels in typical concrete bridge decks subjected to high axle loads. The numerical analyses using the idealized bridge models indicated that the normal stress in bridge decks in the transverse direction can be significantly affected by the thickness of bridge deck, the girder spacing, and the magnitude of the wheel loads. The analyses results also indicated that the normal stresses in the longitudinal direction may be calculated as the summation of the stresses due to global bending of the bridge superstructure under the truck loads, which can be estimated using typical design/rating procedures and the stress elevations near the wheel loads. The proposed equations may be used, in addition to the typical design/rating calculations, to capture the adverse stresses in bridge decks subjected to overweight trucks.","description":"This study investigates the impact of overweight vehicles with heavy axle loads on bridge deck deterioration.

The thesis incorporates three stages of predominantly quantitative research to undertake a comprehensive investigation of the risky driving behaviour of young novices.  Risky driving behaviour increases the likelihood of the young novice driver being involved in a crash which may harm themselves or other road users, and deliberate risky driving such as driving in excess of the posted speed limits is the focus of the program of research.  The extant literature examining the nature of the risky behaviour of the young novice driver - and the contributing factors for this behaviour - while comprehensive, has not led to the development of a reliable instrument designed specifically to measure the risky behaviour of the young novice driver.  Therefore the development and application of such a tool (the Behaviour of Young Novice Drivers Scale, or BYNDS) was foremost in the program of research.  In addition to describing the driving behaviours of the young novice, a central theme of this program of research was identifying, describing, and quantifying personal, behavioural, and environmental influences upon young novice driver risky behaviour.  Accordingly the 11 papers developed from the three stages of research which comprise this thesis are framed within Bandura's reciprocal determinism model which explicitly considers the reciprocal relationship between the environment, the person, and their behaviour.","description":"This thesis investigates the risky driving behaviour of young novice drivers through a comprehensive, self‑reported approach.

Either of the two technologies by themselves – at some high penetrations – may cause some voltage control challenges or overloading problems, respectively. But when combined, there could be synergistic effects, at least intuitively, whereby one technology mitigates the negative impacts of the other. High penetration of EV charging may overload existing distribution system components, most prominently the secondary transformer. If PV technology is installed at residential premises or anywhere downstream of the secondary transformer, it will provide another electricity source, thus relieving the loading on the transformers. Another synergetic or mitigating effect could be envisioned when high PV penetration reverses the power flow upward in the distribution system (from the homes upstream into the distribution system). Protection schemes may then no longer function as designed and voltage violations (exceeding the voltage upper limit of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) voltage range) may occur. In this particular situation, EV charging could consume the generated energy from the PV, such that the reversal of power flow can be reduced or alleviated. Given these potential mutual synergistic behaviors of PV and EV technologies, this project attempted to quantify the benefits of combining the two technologies.","description":"This analysis explores the potential synergies between distributed photovoltaic (PV) generation and electric vehicle (EV) charging.

RRFBs and PHBs were evaluated at a number of Michigan locations, including roundabouts. The findings of these studies suggested that the RRFB and the PHB performed similarly at two-lane roundabout installations, although the PHB appeared to outperform the RRFB at three-lane roundabouts. Furthermore, the PHB and RRFB devices often produced lower motorist yielding levels in Michigan when compared to the results of the larger-scale FHWA studies discussed in the literature review. This result could be due to a lack of familiarity with these devices in Michigan, or driver and pedestrian lack of understanding of Michigan law.

Dual right-turn lanes are increasingly used at urban intersections primarily for two reasons: (1) to accommodate high right-turn demands and avoid turn-pocket overflows, and/or (2) to prevent right-turn vehicles that exit from a nearby upstream freeway off-ramp (on the left of the roadway) from abruptly changing too many lanes toward the right-turn lane at the intersection. In addition, a number of other factors may affect the decisions on the installation of dual right-turn lanes. However, warrants for dual right lane installation are almost non-existent, leaving traffic engineers to rely on engineering judgment. This research aims to develop warrants for installation of dual right-turn lanes at signalized intersections. Both the operational and safety benefits/costs were analyzed by surveying traffic engineers and by conducting traffic simulation-based analysis. Microscopic traffic simulation model, VISSIM, was used to quantify the operation benefits and Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM) developed by Siemens was used to analyze the safety gains due to installation of dual right-turn lanes.","description":"Dual right‑turn lanes are increasingly adopted at urban signalized intersections to handle high right‑turn volumes and to mitigate abrupt lane changes from upstream freeway off‑ramps. They provide dedicated space for deceleration and storage, thereby separating turning vehicles from through traffic. Despite their growing use, formal warrants guiding their installation are virtually absent, leaving engineers to rely on subjective judgment. This study addresses that gap by systematically evaluating the operational and safety implications of dual right‑turn lanes. The research integrates professional input with quantitative simulation to produce evidence‑based warrants for their deployment.","objective":"The primary goal is to develop clear warrants for installing dual right‑turn lanes at signalized intersections. This involves assessing both operational performance and safety outcomes associated with the lane configuration. The study seeks to quantify how dual lanes influence intersection throughput, delay, and capacity. It also aims to determine the extent to which dual lanes reduce conflict points and improve safety for turning vehicles. Ultimately, the objective is to provide traffic engineers with objective criteria to guide decision‑making.","method":"A mixed‑methods approach was employed. First, traffic engineers were surveyed to capture professional perspectives on dual right‑turn lane benefits and costs. Second, microscopic traffic simulation using VISSIM quantified operational metrics such as delay and throughput. Third, the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM) was applied to estimate safety gains from the lane configuration. The combined results inform the development of warrants.","key_findings":["Microscopic simulation revealed measurable reductions in delay and increased intersection capacity when dual right‑turn lanes were implemented.","SSAM analysis indicated a significant decrease in conflict points and potential collision risk for turning vehicles.","Survey responses highlighted a consensus among engineers that dual lanes improve safety and operational performance, yet lack of formal warrants hampers consistent application.","The study provides quantitative thresholds and criteria that can be incorporated into engineering guidelines for dual right‑turn lane installation.","Overall, the research demonstrates that dual right‑turn lanes offer both operational and safety benefits, supporting their broader adoption when warranted."],"keywords":["lane expansion","safety improvement","traffic flow","crash barrier","lane increase","low-cost","urban setting","speed management","intersection safety","signalized intersections"],"source_pdf":"2012_Yi_development-of-warrants-for-installation-of-dual-r_01376183.pdf","related_measures":[{"title":"Impacts on Safety of Left-turn Treatment at High Speed Signalized Intersections","link":"docs/1994_Maze_impacts-on-safety-of-left-turn-treatment-at-high-s_00643607.pdf"},{"title":"Improving Rural Emergency Medical Services (ems) through Transportation System Enhancements Phase Ii","link":"docs/2015_Qin_improving-rural-emergency-medical-services-ems-thr_01594128_1.pdf"},{"title":"Minimizing User Delay and Crash Potential through Highway Work Zone Planning","link":"docs/2014_Kurker_minimizing-user-delay-and-crash-potential-through_01529481.pdf"},{"title":"Safety Impact Evaluation of a Narrow-automated Vehicle Exclusive Reversible Lane on an Existing Smart Freeway","link":"docs/2021_Machiani_safety-impact-evaluation-of-a-narrow-automated-veh_01770408.pdf"},{"title":"Toward Enhancing Estimates of Kentucky's Heavy Truck Tax Liabilities","link":"docs/2002_Mcneill_toward-enhancing-estimates-of-kentucky-s-heavy-tru_00931931.pdf"}]},{"an":"01522057","title":"Co2 Standards and Labels for Heavy Duty Vehicles: a Comparative Analysis of Design Options","abstract":"The European Commission is currently preparing a strategy to address the CO2 emissions from HDVs and is developing a simulation tool to measure their CO2 emissions in addition. It is therefore quite likely that the strategy will include a CO2 standard or label for HDVs. However, due to the complexity of the HDV market, designing a standard (or label) would be highly complex as well and could be operationalised in many different ways (e.g. for the whole vehicle, for one or multiple components, etc.). To inform policy makers in the EU and abroad, this study explores the main advantages and disadvantages of different design options. The study is based on literature and on eleven in-depth interviews with experts, policy makers, manufacturers and NGOs. This report focusses on five design options that have been implemented in other countries and/or are of particular interest to EU policy makers. Each design option was assessed on its effectiveness, market impacts, technical feasibility, and on its legislative impacts. The results from this analysis show that there is no superior design option scoring highest on all above-mentioned criteria. A standard or label for the whole vehicle has the largest benefits in terms of the flexibility that is provided to integrated Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs): they can implement the technologies with the lowest marginal abatements costs, which in turn is argued to result in the lowest end-user costs.

In general knowledge was high. Share the Road and Three Foot Minimum signs were generally more quickly understood and recognized in versions of the sign depicting a sideways view of a bicycle rather than a rear view of a bicyclist/bicycle. Tests with blurred versions of these signs also suggested a legibility advantage for signs depicting a sideways view of a bicycle. In task 2, a simulator study was used to explore whether these differences in comprehension/recognition/legibility had an impact on driver behavior. Drivers navigated a simulated route in which they passed bicyclists riding singly or in groups. Sometimes bicyclists were located within a bike lane, and sometimes a bike lane was not present. The main findings were: (1) drivers generally passed bicyclists with care, allowing clearance much greater than three feet, (2) groups of bicyclists were given more clearance compared to single bicyclists, (3) passing distances were smaller in the presence of oncoming traffic, (4) passing distances were smaller when a bike lane was present, (5) the type of sign and the presence of a sign with the message to give bicyclists at least three feet of clearance did not impact passing distances, and (6) age did not have a significant impact on passing distances. Task 3 examined whether decreased negative offset (minimal offset) left-turn lanes provided a safety advantage to drivers of all ages. Drivers first completed a gap judgment task in the driving simulator. Participants also drove a simulated route and were asked to make turns at intersections featuring a minimal or large negative offset. Findings were: (1) no differences between minimal and negative offsets were observed in gap judgment task, (2) younger adults tolerated smaller gaps in traffic compared to older adults, and (3) the minimal offset resulted in a benefit in the turn execution task; turns were executed in such a way that the distance between the drivers' cars and oncoming traffic was larger compared to the negative offset condition.","description":"This report focuses on aging road user, bicyclist, and pedestrian safety.

The Materials area of the Vehicle Technologies Office focuses on developing lightweight materials for structures and propulsion materials for more efficient powertrain systems. This meeting focused on gaining industry’s perspective on the out-year material requirements of trucks and heavy duty vehicles (HDVs) as well as current technology gaps that limit adoption of designs utilizing these lighter weight materials. The industry experts who participated in this workshop included original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) tier-one suppliers and materials suppliers to the light truck and HDV value chain. The output from this workshop will serve as the foundation for the VTO Materials Roadmap for trucks and HDVs that also supports the objectives of the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Twenty-First Century Truck (21CT) Partnership. The driver for obtaining this updated input is to support the Administration’s goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and U.S. dependence on petroleum. In support of these goals, the mission of the VTO is to develop more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly transportation technologies while meeting or exceeding drivers’ performance expectations and environmental requirements. The following is a list of the primary objectives of this workshop: (1) To understand industry’s needs with respect to out-year requirements and quantitative metrics; (2) To understand technology gaps that inhibit development of materials that will help the industry attain the following objectives: designing the next generation of high-efficiency powertrains, minimize efficiency penalties by reducing exhaust emissions, provide aerodynamic solutions with minimal weight penalty, develop lightweighting that improves the fuel economy of light duty trucks and the freight efficiency of HDVs, reduce petroleum dependence by developing propulsion materials that are compatible with advanced fuels, and significantly accelerate the adoption of these technologies by expanding the capabilities of modeling and design tools; and (3) To provide a forum for input by industry experts and for developing consensus on targets, gaps, and performance metrics. The purpose of the workshop is to understand what technologies must be developed in order to realize these objectives.

Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of work-related fatalities among young people in the United States ages 16 to 24. From 2003 to 2010, 843 workers ages 16 to 24 died in motor vehicle crashes at work. These incidents accounted for 22% of all workplace fatalities in this age group. In 67% of these incidents, the young worker was driving the vehicle involved in the crash. Risk for young workers is highest in the waste management, mining, and agriculture industries. In many of these industries, younger workers are at higher risk of dying in a motor vehicle crash at work than adult workers ages 25 or older. Although most young adults are allowed by law to drive on the job starting at age 18, they lack the maturity and driving experience of their older co-workers. Young drivers might also be more likely to engage in driving behaviors that increase their risk of injury or death, such as not wearing seat belts and driving while distracted.

Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of work-related fatalities among young people in the United States ages 16 to 24. From 2003 to 2010, 843 workers ages 16 to 24 died in motor vehicle crashes at work. These incidents accounted for 22% of all workplace fatalities in this age group. In 67% of these incidents, the young worker was driving the vehicle involved in the crash. Federal child labor laws severely limit workplace driving by youth under 18 years of age. Although most young adults are allowed by law to drive on the job starting at age 18, they lack the maturity and driving experience of their older co-workers. Young drivers might also be more likely to engage in driving behaviors that increase their risk of injury or death, such as not wearing seat belts or driving while distracted. If you are a parent of a teen or young adult who drives as part of his or her job, it is important that you understand the risk for motor vehicle crashes at work.

The young drivers’ vehicles were equipped with an event-triggered video recording device for 24 weeks. Half of the participants received feedback regarding their driving, and the other half received no feedback at all and served as a control group. The number of safety-relevant events per 1,000 miles (i.e., “event rate”) was analyzed for 90 participants who completed the study. On average, the young drivers who received the video-based intervention had significantly lower event rates than those in the control group. This finding was true for all three groups. An effect of experience was seen for drivers in the control group; the 16-year-olds with driving experience had significantly lower event rates than the 16-year-olds without experience. When the intervention concluded, an increase in event rate was seen for the school license holders, but not for either group of 16-year-old drivers. There is strong evidence that giving young drivers video-based feedback, regardless of their age or level of driving experience, is effective in reducing the rate of safety-relevant events relative to a control group who do not receive feedback. Specific comparisons with regard to age and experience indicated that the age of the driver did not have an effect on the rate of safety-events, while experience did.

This diminishes the advantages of reduced costs and reduced driving time that would make freeways theoretically superior to arterial streets. According to previous literature, however, this phenomenon is to be expected and is not an indicator of the efficiency or inefficiency of having new freeways. Due to Downs’s Law of Peak-hour Traffic Congestion, we expect freeways to immediately fill upon construction, simply because they do offer superior benefits to roadway users compared to the alternative arterial streets. Rational drivers choose to enjoy these benefits. Another phenomenon cited in the literature review is that of induced travel, which states that with the reduction in travel time posed by using freeway segments, it can also be expected that more commuters will choose to travel on them than otherwise would. When Downs’s Law works synergistically with the phenomenon of induced travel, more vehicles can be accommodated in a given geographical area, thus increasing the total number of trips taken. This adds to the overall value of our transportation system, since after all, the value of that system is predicated on its ability to facilitate increased volume of travel. This report is based on data acquired from the State of Arizona, the City of Phoenix and Maricopa County, Arizona, and other sources. Through the analysis of Maricopa County traffic count data, a significant increase in traffic volume is shown due to the addition of new freeways. This increase in traffic volume accounts for a net benefit of over $18 million dollars per year for a given mile-long stretch of roadway. Over a freeway design-life of 20 years this is far in excess of the average of $72 million needed to construct that mile of freeway. Ultimately, any evaluation of the freeway system must take into consideration the explicit and implicit benefits of the system. Congestion is going to be present whether new freeways are constructed or not. Before freeway segments are constructed, the existing arterial streets are congested. After the completion of freeway segments, some drivers shift from arterial streets to the new freeway. This lessens traffic on the arterials, leading to more drivers taking trips they previously avoided (i.e. induced travel). Even though congestion is an inevitable condition, even on freeway segments post-construction, freeways still offer a clear net benefit.","description":"This report examines the impact of new freeway segments on traffic volume and congestion.

The 2010 HCM has revised the method for calculating delay. This happened concurrent with such jurisdictions as New York City (NYC) reviewing the use of the HCM method in their environmental impact regulations (e.g. City Environmental Quality Review (CEQR) process), and concurrent with a dialog in the  profession on when it is appropriate to use simulation models in lieu of HCM methods. This effort focused on providing guidance on how to use the 2010 HCM signalized intersection method in the context of the NYC urban environment. It was deemed important by New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) to verify whether the delay and saturation flow estimates were consistent with what is found in the field in New York City, and specifically Manhattan. It was decided to measure and do analyses of the following measures of effectiveness: Saturation flow rate, Delay, and Start-up lost time.    The authors began the process with meetings with NYCDOT staff to determine what data was available and what level of analysis was needed. The HCM signalized intersection methodology is known to not work well in oversaturated conditions unless a  multi-period analysis is done. Since the analysis that NYCDOT does with the HCM always uses a 15-minute period analysis and  not a multi-period one, it was decided to only look at intersections that were not oversaturated when measuring and comparing  delay results. The HCM 2010 arterial analysis methodology does consider queues and oversaturated conditions that should better reflect  conditions in NYC, given that NYC is made up of arterial streets and not individual isolated intersections. However, the standard  method used and required by CEQR is the signalized intersection methodology. This then was another factor in deciding not to use  oversaturated intersections. It was found that the field data of saturation flow and delay were well correlated with the values computed using the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual methodologies, but that the start-up lost times that are defaulted and used in an HCM analysis are very different from the values measured in field data.","description":"This study aimed to relate the 2010 Signalized Intersection Methodology to alternate approaches in the context of New York City (NYC) conditions.

Also, this study is used to respond to Louisiana Senate Concurrent Resolution 35 (SCR-35). The superstructure of the bridge in this study was evaluated for safety and reliability under four different kinds of truck configuration and loads hauling sugarcane. The bridge model was verified by performing live load tests using 3S3 trucks with a gross vehicular weight (GVW) of 100,000 lb. on the structure. The bridge finite element model was analyzed under the different kinds of loading and the effects were listed and compared. The results of the analyses show that the pattern of response of the bridge under the different cases follows the same trend. Among the four different cases of loading configurations, case 4, which was GVW =148,000 lb. and a vehicle length of 92 ft., produced the largest tensile and compressive stresses in the members. The results from the bridge deck analyses confirm that the bridge deck is under a stable stress state, whether the stresses are in the tension zone or the compression zone. The heavy load as indicated in SCR-35 will cause damage to bridges. The data from the monitoring system indicates that the average number of heavy loads during October, November, and December is 3.5 times higher than the rest of the year. The bridges are exposed to high cycles of repetition of heavy loads that will reduce the life span of the bridges by about 50%. The bridges that are built to last 75 years will be replaced after about 40 years in service. This seasonal impact is due to the sugarcane harvest and confirms the cost of fatigue, $0.9 per truck per trip per bridge, as determined in the previous study. Based on the results of the studies presented in this report, increasing the gross vehicle weight of sugarcane trucks is not recommended. The heavy loads indicated in SCR-35 will cause premature fatigue damage to the main structural members and could cause their eventual structural failure. In addition, the majority of the Louisiana bridges currently in service were designed to accommodate lower loads than the bridge tested on this project. Therefore, based on the test results, one should expect that the proposed trucks to significantly shorten the remaining life span of Louisiana bridges. All these bridges should be rehabilitated prior to implementing SCR 35. The data from the monitoring system will provide a good source of information to review the current serviceability criteria used by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (LADOTD) for the design of prestressed concrete bridge girders.","description":"This study evaluates the effects of heavy loads on Louisiana state bridges, specifically focusing on the load distribution and fatigue cost estimates.

FDOT’s FREEPLAN and HIGHPLAN software programs utilize truck passenger car equivalency (PCE) values from the HCM to account for the effects of trucks on traffic flow operations. The PCE values in the HCM used for freeways and multilane highways are based on a study performed in the mid-1990s. Since that time, commercial truck performance technologies have changed. Furthermore, loading conditions are considerably different today, given the tremendous growth in freight movement. Additionally, the PCE values developed in that study were based strictly on simulation and a now outdated version of CORSIM (5.0). And finally, the PCE values taken from that study for inclusion in the HCM correspond to just a single “typical” truck (although the study considered multiple categories of trucks), which may not be representative of a typical truck in Florida, and accounting for just a single truck type may lead to considerable error in level of service results in some situations. Therefore, the objective of this project was to develop PCE values appropriate for commercial truck conditions on Florida freeways and multilane highways. The most prevalent truck types on Florida freeways and multilane highways were determined to be single unit, intermediate/interstate semi-tractor+trailer, and semi-tractor+double- trailer trucks. The CORSIM-NG simulation program was utilized to generate the traffic stream data for this study, as this program incorporates a more detailed truck acceleration model than other available simulation tools. In order to develop the PCE values, the methodology introduced into the literature by Sumner et al. was used. This methodology has also been utilized by others (e.g., Webster and Elefteriadou). Once the PCE calculations were run and the values were obtained for the three heavy vehicle types of interest, it was observed that PCE values generally increase with increases in proportion of grade, length of grade, traffic demand, free-flow-speed, and proportion of heavy vehicles. Conversely, the PCE values generally decrease as the number of lanes increases. Although it is difficult to directly compare the PCE values from this study to those of the HCM 2010 because the HCM values are much more generalized, for the same input conditions the PCE values from this study are generally slightly lower, which is largely due to the higher power-to-weight ratios of the trucks used in this study and the more detailed vehicle dynamics modeling.","description":"The Florida Department of Transportation's (FDOT) guide for conducting highway capacity and level of service analyses is based on the Transportation Research Board's Highway Capacity Manual (HCM).

Understanding and modeling speeding and speed control is one of the major challenges in human performance modeling which involves: a) the modeling of several aspects of human cognitive system: perception, decision making and motor control as well as their interaction with the vehicle model; and b) individual differences in speed control and prediction of speeding in real time. However, few of existing computational models are able to cover all of these important aspects together. To address this problem, the main objective of this project is to build a new mathematical driver speed control model and apply it to develop an intelligent speeding control system. Multi‐disciplinary approaches are used to build the mathematical model of driver speed control, integrating methods in operations research (Queuing Network-Model Human Processor, QN-MHP) and theories in psychology (Rule-Based Decision Field Theory, RDFT) to predict driving speed, pedal angle, acceleration, the time when drivers exceed the speed limit and the magnitude of speeding. The model not only quantifies an average driver's speed control behavior, but also models individual drivers' decision making references and impulsiveness. A human driver experimental study has been conducted to validate the prediction of the model. The model is implemented in a real-time intelligent speeding control system, which provides warnings to drivers to prevent speeding proactively. The intelligent system online monitors the pedal behavior of a driver, calculates the probability of speeding for that driver in the next few seconds, and proactively provides necessary warnings to that driver to prevent his or her speeding behavior in real-time.","description":"Speeding is identified as the leading cause of fatal accidents in New York State, prompting a need for advanced modeling of driver speed control.

The vast majority of crossings (89 percent of the total observed) took place in the marked intersection crosswalks. Drivers are likely to yield to pedestrians. However, while drivers are more likely to yield to pedestrians in the marked crosswalk, pedestrians and vehicles are equally as likely to yield to one another outside the marked crosswalk.

Due to the high number of pedestrian crashes, Texas is considered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to be a “focus” state. Researchers found that 2 percent of all Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)-reportable traffic crashes and 15 percent of all TxDOT-reportable fatal crashes were pedestrian related. Most non-fatal crashes are associated with daylight, at intersections, and on city streets, whereas most fatal crashes are associated with dark conditions, midblock locations, and high-speed roadways. Twenty-one percent of all fatal TxDOT-reportable pedestrian crashes occurred on freeways—a location where pedestrians are least expected. Additional research into how to address pedestrian crashes, especially freeway crashes, is needed, perhaps using FHWA’s new systematic safety project selection tool. In the past decade, the pedestrian hybrid beacon (PHB) and rectangular rapid-flashing beacon (RRFB) have shown great potential in improving driver yielding rates and conditions for crossing pedestrians. Researchers conducted a field study at 7 traffic control signal (TCS) sites, 22 RRFB sites, and 32 PHB sites in Texas with the effectiveness measure being the percent of drivers yielding to a staged pedestrian. Results showed that driver yielding rates varied by type of treatment. Overall, TCSs in Texas have the highest driver yielding rates (98 percent), followed by PHBs (89 percent) and RRFBs (86 percent). Those cities with a greater number of a particular device (i.e., Austin for the PHB and Garland for the RRFB) had higher driver yielding rates as compared to cities where the device was only used at a few crossings. Also, as drivers became more familiar with the PHB, a greater proportion yielded, perhaps because they  gained a better understanding of expectations or requirements over time. As part of this study, researchers conducted a before-and-after field study at four RRFB sites and one PHB site to identify the changes in driver yielding and selected pedestrian behaviors resulting from installing these treatments at previously untreated crosswalks. The installations resulted in noticeable improvement in the number of yielding vehicles.","description":"The study focuses on pedestrian crashes in Texas, analyzing data from 2007 to 2011.

Included in the set of models are those that predict the expected delays that cars collectively incur when a bus blocks one of multiple lanes while loading and unloading passengers at the stop. Others in this set predict the expected added delays incurred by the bus due to car queues. Each model is consistent with the kinematic wave theory of highway traffic, as is confirmed through a battery of tests. Each accounts for the randomness in both bus arrival times at a stop, and the durations that buses dwell there to serve passengers. Though the models are analytical in form, solutions come through iteration. Hence model applications are performed with the aid of a computer. The applications presented herein show that bus delays can often be shortened by placing the bus stop downstream of its neighboring signalized intersection, rather than upstream of it. In contrast, car delays are often shortened by placing the stop some distance upstream of the intersection, rather than downstream. The authors further show how exerting a measure of control on bus arrivals can further enhance these benefits to cars without further delaying the buses. The models are also used to assess the net person delays collectively incurred by car- and bus-travelers.","description":"This study investigates the impacts of bus stops located near signalized intersections on car and bus delays.

In addition to the development of the framework, this project aimed to establish connections between Portland State University (PSU) researchers with regional connections involved in public health research, non-emergency medical transportation, medical services, and medical insurance provision. With the rising costs of transportation and medical costs generally in the United States, it is increasingly important to develop new tools and strategies to reduce these costs while maintaining and improving upon the level of care provided. Ultimately, the inability to afford NEMT can lead to missed appointments and reduced access to medical care for vulnerable populations, which in turn can lead to more trips to the emergency room and reduced quality of life. This impacts not only individuals, but the communities that these individuals are a part of. A robust literature review and background research laid the groundwork for this project. This literature review provides an overview of the body of literature that analyzes how non-emergency medical transportation is provided in the United States and also highlights gaps in the existing research. Special attention is paid to the challenges of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), who require routine NEMT service for dialysis appointments. The emerging focus on community-based participatory research (CBPR) is also discussed as a potential tool for better incorporating qualitative data into future analyses of the costs and benefits of providing NEMT. In this process, the authors identified key strategies for improving NEMT, including better coordination between dialysis clinics and NEMT providers, consideration of fixed-route transportation and improvements in dispatch technology.  The authors developed a framework for evaluating NEMT program changes that centers on a hybrid cost-benefit analysis matrix, modeled on a CBPR approach developed by Stevens et al. for their 2008 evaluation of an Australian childcare strategy. The matrix was refined via feedback from Ride Connection’s advisory committee, and is tailored to many of the unique challenges facing NEMT programs.

The objective of this project is to quantify the effects of construction type and its intensity on work zone capacity and to develop guidelines for Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) to estimate the specific operation type and intensity that will improve the traffic flow by reducing the traffic flow and queue length commonly associated with work zones.

A statistical comparison between the capacity values found in this study using either methodologies indicates that there is an effect of construction activity on the values work zone capacity. It was found that the heavy construction activity reduces the capacity. It is very beneficial to conduct similar studies on the capacity of work zone with different lane closure barriers, which is also directly related to the type of work zone being short-term or long-term work zones.

The surface transportation system has been a critical component for the movement of goods and services by the trucking industry across the country. Recent decades have seen substantial growth in freight miles traveled, due to globalization, trade growth, and improvements in logistics and supply chain management. Although these developments have led to economic growth, there has been a sharp increase in the proportion of freight/truck traffic traveling along key routes that has caused significant interactions between trucks and other vehicles. These interactions have raised safety and capacity concerns on the freeways.  Interstate 80 was identified for this research because of the high percentage of truck traffic (40%-70%) that it carries. This Interstate is a popular route for most freight transporting goods from the east (Chicago) to the west (California) and vice versa. Interstate 80 in the states of Wyoming and Nebraska was selected as a test case for this research, which seeks to develop a statistical modeling of the relationship between the high percent trucks and crash rates.

One of the field inventory reviews that many states have a difficult time reporting efficiently is the required horizontal curve classification for each HPMS section.

The vehicles can be dedicated towards a certain fuel, or accepting different types of fuel blends where at least part of the fuel consists of conventional types (i.e. diesel or petrol). In recent years, new fuels and blends have been introduced on the market. In Europe, the Commission has presented a road map towards a low carbon economy 2050, a white paper on transport and a proposal for alternative fuel infrastructure.

This is particularly the case for technology-driven safety improvement projects that are  frequently updated or replaced by newer ones before it is possible to gather adequate crash data for a  reliable and defensible before-after evaluation. Surrogate safety data are commonly used as an alternative  to crash data; however, its current practice is still resource intensive and subject to human errors. The  advent of connected vehicle technology allows vehicles to communicate with each other and infrastructure  wirelessly. This platform also offers the opportunity for automated and continuous tracking of vehicle  trajectories and signal status at the facilities in real time. These types of data can potentially be extracted  and used to detect the deficiencies in the safety performance of the facility operation. This project examines the viability of long-term monitoring of connected vehicle data for safety performance evaluation. As limited saturation of onboard equipment (OBE) is expected in the near-term evolution, the study focuses on a connected vehicle application that can process data elements from OBEs via vehicle-to-infrastructure communications using standard message sets. To accomplish the objective, a signalized intersection test bed was created in VISSIM while the wireless communications capability and the application were implemented using Car-to-Everything Application Programming Interface. The  evaluation results indicated that the application can effectively detect changes in safety performance at full  market penetration. Sensitivity analysis showed that at least 40 percent penetration rate is desirable for  reliable safety deficiency detection under light to moderate traffic volume conditions. The observation  period can be extended to compensate for low sample size under low OBE market penetrations. The  required observation periods vary with the types of safety indicators being collected and the levels of OBE  saturation.","description":"This project explores the use of connected vehicle technology for long-term monitoring of safety performance at signalized intersections.

The prototype executes 2 tasks: 1. Accesses weather information that provides near real-time atmospheric and pavement surface condition observations; and 2. Adapts signal timing in response to inclement weather. The proposed system architecture employs 2 revolutionary software design approaches: 1. Design for Survivability; and 2. Software performance measurement at the task level. Furthermore, the software design incorporates self-diagnostic techniques for fault detection and recovery to maximize the survivability and the security of the system. Minimal hardware is required for full implementation of the system as it operates and achieves its potential using current traffic signal controller and cabinet standards and technologies. As a result, it is compatible with future applications within the Federal Highway Administrations (FHWA’s) connected-vehicle framework. The weather-responsive traffic signal system presented in this report serves as a major milestone in the development of secure and dependable real-time traffic control system applications. The system was initially tested in a hardware-in-the-loop simulation environment. It was also field implemented at an intersection in the City of Moscow, Idaho. The results of the simulation environment testing indicated that the weather-responsive traffic signal system reduces the potentials for crashes while having minimal impact on delay and stops. The results showed that the system, on average, reduces the potentials for rear-end crashes, crossing crashes, and lane change crashes by 5.7 percent, 31.3 percent, and 6.3 percent, respectively. The results from the field implementation were consistent with those obtained from the simulation model. They show that, when the snow/ice signal timing plan was implemented with longer yellow interval and passage time values, the number of vehicles running the red-light during snow and ice conditions dropped significantly from 7.94 percent for passenger vehicles and 14.18 percent for trucks to 3.5 percent for passenger vehicles and 7.81 percent for trucks.

To date, research has focused upon assistive pedestrian signal technologies for pedestrians with impaired vision. Such individuals must learn to cross complex intersections safely using a range of sensory inputs, including auditory cues from traffic surge and beaconing systems. Unfortunately, reduced vehicle noise, particularly for hybrid or electric vehicles, combined with increases in background sound levels, reduces the effectiveness of this approach. Furthermore, once the signal changes and the pedestrian starts to cross, there is very little communication with the pedestrian other than the possibility of active beaconing. The traffic controller has no way of knowing how far pedestrians have progressed and whether they are still in the crosswalk. This project is proposing the integration of commercial technologies commonly found in smartphones and other mobile electronics into a framework that will provide for pedestrian tracking and navigation. Such capability would allow the pedestrian signal device to take corrective action, such as providing navigational corrections or extending the walk signal (in extreme circumstances). With a \"technology-neutral\" framework (using a device other than a smartphone), this pedestrian support can be expanded to other avenues, such as railway crossings, bus terminals, and airports.","description":"The study addresses the growing need to accommodate pedestrians with reduced capabilities amid changing U.S. demographics.

A review of published literature, as well as real-world demonstration activities, indicate that bollard-level crosswalk lighting has excellent potential for enhancing pedestrian visibility and improving safety at crosswalks, particularly where the presence of a crosswalk might not be expected by approaching drivers. Such locations include midblock crossings, roundabouts and locations near schools and other public venues that might experience high levels of pedestrian traffic at sporadic or unexpected times. The light levels produced by the system and measured during a nighttime demonstration installation were sufficient to achieve high levels of visual performance. The push button control used by the prototype bollard system allowed the luminaires to produce a relatively low, glare-free light level when not in use, while still making them highly visible to pedestrians and drivers. The temporary cycling between low and high light levels that occurred when the button was pressed could act as a visual alert to warn drivers that a pedestrian is present and waiting to cross the street, and the higher light level of at least 10 vertical lux in the crosswalk resulted in high levels of visibility.","description":"The study focuses on demonstrating urban outdoor lighting for pedestrian safety and security.

The modeling dataset consisted of 964 crashes from a total of 73 intersections that were randomly selected based on the presence of a traffic signal (identified through the crash data records). The SPFs were developed using a Poisson-lognormal Generalized Linear Mixed model framework for total crashes and severe injury crashes (coded as KAB). Three SPFs were developed: 1) an SPF for total crashes, which relies on both major and minor Average Annual Daily Traffics (AADTs) to predict the expected number of crashes; 2) an SPF for KAB crashes, whose predictions derive from both AADTs as well as from the speed limit on the major road; and (3) a severity model to predict the proportion of KAB crashes to be used in combination with the SPF for total crashes. The research analyses determined that the speed limit variable significantly improved the quality of the SPFs and severity model, and as expected, suggests increasing severity with speed differentials. The models were validated spatially and temporally based on additional sites and using an additional year of data. The models all performed well during the validation; however enhanced models to improve model reliability were developed based on the larger dataset. As part of the model development, this research also explored a variety of rules to identify crashes as intersection-related based on the crash geo-location (including the common 250 feet rule). Crashes were manually classified from the combined data available from the geo-location of crashes, the geometric database, and the various fields in the Oregon crash database. These classifications were then compared to a number of rule options for classifying them as intersection crashes. The analysis revealed that the best performing rule is to use crashes that were geo-located within 300 feet of the centerline intersection at signalized locations plus crashes where the crash report indicates that they were associated with a traffic control device (i.e. traffic signal). Finally, this research effort developed models to estimate minor road AADT for use in safety analysis where this exposure information is not available. These models were developed from data from 66 intersections with known minor and major AADT volumes and validated with data from another 25 intersections. Significant model variables included major AADT, number of approach lanes, functional class, presence of a two-way left-turn lane, and parallel road AADT.","description":"This research effort aimed to develop new safety performance functions (SPFs) for signalized intersections in Oregon.

The work indicated that, as in New Zealand, the practice overseas was for road safety strategists not to attempt to influence modal split in the direction of safer PT modes, but rather to accept the levels of modal split resulting from government PT policies and then to ensure that the system which results is managed according to Safe System principles. This would mean including in Safer Journeys PT-related injuries not at present covered in Safer Journeys actions. This would require no structural change, just a restatement of the reach of the strategy and the inclusion of some new areas of interest and action plans. To achieve this, the whole journey rather than just the road phase needs consideration. Data on injury related to all aspects of the journey should be gathered and analysed; safety expertise can be positioned in organisational structures to influence how PT is operated, and tools to better monitor PT safety can be made available and used.","description":"This study explores how urban public transport can contribute to safer journeys within the Safe System framework.

Pedestrian safety at signalized intersections is the most serious concern due to frequent and severe conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians. Pedestrian features directly related to pedestrian safety are used to increase driver compliance behaviors and reduce vehicle-pedestrian conflicts. This project aimed to explore driver behaviors at signalized intersections with four identified pedestrian features—“STOP HERE ON RED,” “NO TURN ON RED,” “TURNING VEHICLES YIELD TO PEDESTRIANS,” and “RIGHT ON RED ARROW AFTER STOP” signs—by using an innovative safety data source, the Strategic Highway Research Program 2 (SHRP 2) Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) data. To improve data processing efficiency, two software tools were developed to assist researchers in data reduction in an automatic and/or semi-automatic manner: (1) the NDS Automatic Video Processing Tool, which automatically detects and tracks pedestrians and traffic signal indications in NDS videos, and (2) the NDS Data Reduction and Analysis Tool, which assists researchers in reviewing and analyzing NDS videos and sensor data. A cross-sectional analysis was used to assess the safety effectiveness of the selected pedestrian features by comparing the observed compliant driver behaviors between two groups: a feature group (with the pedestrian feature) and a control group (without the pedestrian feature). Chi-square tests were used to determine whether the proportional difference of compliant driver behaviors between the two groups was significant. The major findings were the following: (1) The “NO TURN ON RED” sign had the highest rate of compliance (70%), followed by “RIGHT ON RED ARROW AFTER STOP” (67%), “TURNING VEHICLES YIELD TO PEDESTRIANS” (67%), and “STOP HERE ON RED” (55%). (2) Three features—“STOP HERE ON RED,” “NO TURN ON RED,” and “RIGHT ON RED ARROW AFTER STOP” signs—increased the likelihood of compliant behaviors compared to control groups. (3) Drivers had a much higher compliance percentage at the feature sites than at the control sites (67% vs. 29%) when pedestrians were not present at intersections; the difference was statistically significant. (4) Drivers generally were sensitive to pedestrian presence at both the feature sites and the control sites; the compliance percentages for both groups were higher when pedestrians were present than those when pedestrians were absent. (5) Drivers were more likely to comply with the feature at feature sites when pedestrians were present than at control sites (77% vs. 50%); however, there was no evidence to show the difference was statistically significant due to a small sample size. (6) Based on self-evaluation, female drivers were significantly more likely to believe they are easily distracted when driving compared to male drivers; older drivers (age 60+) believe they take significantly fewer risks and are less distracted than other drivers. (7) Female drivers tended to comply more consistently with the feature than male drivers.

While many types of horizontal curves can be used in the geometric design of a roadway, simple circular curves are typically used. Other curve types that can be used include compound and spiral curves. The development of a quick, reliable, and efficient method for identification of horizontal curves and extraction of their geometric parameters from road inventory data is of immense benefit to transportation agencies and traffic safety. Efficient and reliable identification of horizontal curves and extraction of geometric parameters like radius, degree of curvature, point of curvature, and point of tangency can be used by transportation agencies to set advisory speeds, perform design and safety audits, select placement of curve warning signs, and evaluate vehicle crashes that occur at or near horizontal curve locations on the roadway. Phase II of this project attempts to create a software package that can automate the process of identifying the point of curvature and point of tangency of every curve on the state network in Connecticut.

Flange climb derailments are more frequent and can occur at low velocity. It is believed that the flange wheel climb, which is often associated with a large angle of attack (AOA), is the result of a tangential force that produces a contact force that acts upward at the wheel/rail contact point. The wheel lift, on the other hand, can be the result of hunting-produced high lateral velocity and large impact forces that can cause derailments. In this derailment scenario, the tangential force at one wheel can be downward as the result of the wheel life at the other wheel. This project is concerned with flange wheel climb derailments that occur at a large wheelset angle of attack. A fully nonlinear unconstrained multibody system (MBS) wheel climb derailment model is developed to analyze the forces that govern the wheel climb motion when oriented at a large scale AOA. The results of the MBS model in the vicinity of the climb initiation are verified using a semi-analytical model that makes use of simplifying assumptions derived from the current interpretation of wheel climb.","description":"This research project focuses on investigating flange wheel climb derailments that occur at a large angle of attack in rail vehicles.

This project investigates the use of a fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite system for in situ repair that minimizes potential traffic interruptions. The FRP repair system consists of a filler material to restore a circular cross-section, a primer or adhesive layer, a pre-impregnated or field-impregnated FRP laminate, and a final coating for aesthetics and UV protection. The objective of this study is to develop a set of repair guidelines that can economically and effectively restore an impact-damaged utility pole to a safe working condition. The research plan was divided into three stages. The first stage is a material characterization of the constituents of several likely FRP repair systems, including characterization of the efficacy for installation on vertical poles. The second stage investigates the component-level responses of the repair systems. Mechanical testing to failure was performed for a variety of pole and dent geometries in a standard four-point flexural test setup. The final stage involves verifying the component-level tests using full-scale poles. The poles utilized for testing included both actual poles removed from service with vehicular impact damage as well as poles with mechanically-imparted dents. All full-scale tests were performed on poles with integral base plates oriented in a cantilever configuration and subjected the specimens to flexural monotonic loads to failure, cyclic fatigue loads to failure, and impact loads simulating vehicular impact using a pendulum. Geometric irregularities in the pole and access ports (hand holes) make design of the repair systems challenging. Laminates were oriented in the longitudinal direction on the tension and compression faces with transverse (circumferential) wraps located above and below any obstructions. Results show the repairs to be effective at restoring capacity, resisting cyclic/fatigue load demands, and not prone to instability when impacted with the equivalent of a light vehicle at low speed.","description":"This project investigates the use of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite systems for in situ repair of impact-damaged utility poles.

Road collisions remain one of the highest external causes of death for young people. The risks are especially high for young males and for young riders. This high collision risk is caused by a combination of factors. Biological and social changes between the ages of 15-25 affect the risk perception of young people and lead to an increase in social activity and associated pressure from peers. A lack of experience on the road means that young people are worse at anticipating and reacting to hazards. They are also less aware of how best to drive and ride in particular road conditions and situations. A range of impairments and distractions affect young people. This is linked to the increased social activity they experience during the ages of 15-25, which includes a greater exposure to alcohol and drugs, the influence of peer-age passengers and the effects of fatigue. In-car distraction from mobile devices is also a problem. Young people tend to drive smaller and older vehicles as they are cheaper and more practical. These cars often have a lower crashworthiness and lack the safety technologies featured in newer, larger cars. The use of seat belts and protective clothing is also poor amongst young people. A variety of countermeasures have been adopted across Europe and further afield, with the aim of reducing the collision risk of young people. Recommendations have been made here based on those countermeasures shown to be most effective.","description":"The paper highlights that young drivers and riders aged 15 to 25 experience higher fatality rates on European roads compared to older cohorts, despite overall road safety improvements. It identifies a combination of biological, social, and behavioural factors that elevate collision risk, such as developmental changes affecting risk perception, increased social activity, peer pressure, and exposure to alcohol, drugs, and fatigue. Lack of driving experience leads to poorer hazard anticipation and reaction, while limited awareness of safe driving practices in varied conditions further compounds danger. Additional contributors include the use of smaller, older vehicles with lower crashworthiness, inadequate safety technology, and poor seat belt and protective clothing compliance.

An array of existing traffic control devices existed at the study sites, including various crosswalk marking strategies, along with additional treatments, such as pedestrian hybrid beacons (PHBs), rectangular rapid-flashing beacons (RRFBs) and single in-street R1-6 signs. The sites also collectively included a diverse set of roadway and traffic characteristics, including crossing widths, number of lanes, and median presence, along with vehicular, pedestrian, and bicyclist volumes. Three primary evaluations were performed for the midblock segments and signalized intersection study sites, including: driver yielding compliance, vehicle-pedestrian conflicts, and non-motorized traffic crash data. The yielding compliance study found that the type of crosswalk treatment has a strong influence over driver yielding compliance. While yielding compliance improves substantially when crosswalk markings are utilized, the highest compliance rates are achieved when an additional enhancement device (i.e., RRFB, PHB, or R1-6 sign), is also provided. To supplement small crash sample sizes at the study sites, Michigan statewide pedestrian and bicyclist crash data were collected and utilized to develop safety performance functions (SPFs) and other methods for predicting pedestrian and bicyclist crashes at road segments and intersections. Because pedestrian and bicyclist volumes were not available statewide, each model was developed for pedestrian and bicycle crashes based solely on vehicular annual average daily traffic (AADT). In general, the models showed that pedestrian and bicycle crashes tend to increase with increasing traffic volumes. However, even in the highest volume cases, only a fraction of crashes involved a pedestrian or bicyclist. Pedestrian and bicycle crashes were further estimated based on the respective proportion of the Michigan specific SPF models for total crashes.

Video cameras can be used to monitor pedestrian traffic in a setting where a static camera that has an unobstructed view of the road is used to detect and track pedestrians. However, simply detecting a pedestrian is not enough to fully describe the motion of that person within the context of the intersection: it is also necessary to determine where that person is located. The correct placement of a person within the intersection requires both the intrinsic and extrinsic calibration of each camera, so that geometric locations on the surfaces where pedestrians move can be transformed to pixels in each camera’s image and vice versa. Traditional approaches to camera calibration work well for the intrinsic part, and can be conducted before the cameras are mounted. However, the extrinsic calibration part requires elements that are not well suited for this application (e.g. collection of multiple images showing a calibration target at different locations), and are time consuming. This study intends to reduce the time and amount of effort needed to calibrate and set up a video camera at any location. In this work the research team focused on developing an approach to calibrate traffic cameras that simplifies the extrinsic calibration work on-site using a low-cost custom-made laser scanner, and that requires minimal personnel training.","description":"Traffic intersections often lack real-time awareness of pedestrian movements, with existing perception systems limited to detecting vehicles at specific points. Video cameras can monitor pedestrian flow when positioned with an unobstructed view of the road, but mere detection does not capture the full motion context. Accurate placement of pedestrians within the intersection requires both intrinsic and extrinsic camera calibration to map image pixels to real-world coordinates. While intrinsic calibration can be performed offline, extrinsic calibration traditionally demands time-consuming procedures and unsuitable calibration targets. This study proposes a streamlined extrinsic calibration method that employs a low-cost custom laser scanner, reducing on-site effort and training requirements. The approach aims to enable rapid deployment of traffic cameras for pedestrian monitoring across diverse intersection layouts. By simplifying calibration, the system seeks to enhance the reliability and scalability of pedestrian behavior analysis at intersections.","objective":"The primary objective is to minimize the time and effort required to calibrate traffic cameras for pedestrian monitoring at intersections.

All references to the laboratory herein will follow the BEAST lab naming convention. The equipment developed under this grant remains the Heavy Vehicle Load Simulator for Bridge Deck Testing Application. Given the importance of overcoming the challenges associated with aging and deteriorating bridges, and the need for a full scale proving ground for evaluation of new and advanced materials and devices, CAIT has procured a full-scale load testing equipment. The Heavy Vehicle Load Simulator for Bridge Deck Testing Application is a one-of-a-kind testing equipment that will evaluate full scale bridge elements and bridge decks in an accelerated manner. CAIT collaborated with Applied Research Associates (ARA) to prepare, design and fabricate the Heavy Vehicle Load Simulator. The equipment will evaluate the samples by applying realistic traffic and environmental loading conditions in a greatly compressed timeframe, simulating 15 years of deterioration in 6 months (30 fold). This equipment, for the first time, will allow the scientific study of deterioration processes on full-scale bridges. Since deterioration processes operate over long durations and at a glacial time-scale, time compression is highly desirable. The innovative manners, implemented in this laboratory, to accelerate deterioration processes without distorting them will provide bridge owners with critical information in the near-term. The equipment is a large complex system enclosing a 125’ long by 75’ wide footprint and standing 13’- 6” tall. The equipment consists of a load chassis applying a 60,000lb load in an enclosed environmental chamber that weathers the test sample, simulating seasonal temperature fluctuations (0°F to 104°F) and applying deicing salts (as per current practice during the simulated winter months).

Traditional methods, either using historical crash data collected from infrequently happened collisions, or potential conflicts estimated from microscopic simulation which assumes “accident-free”, cannot provide accurate and timely evaluation of intersection safety. In contrast, this research proposes a comprehensive intersection safety evaluation system, which is able to quantify the safety performance of signalized intersections by using high-resolution traffic signal data collected from existing loop detection systems. This research proposes an innovative method to identify the emerging and impending hazardous situations including red-light running (RLR) violations and potential traffic conflicts, which essentially indicate the safety level of an intersection. The proposed method first estimates the drivers’ decision to stop-or-run (SoR) by developing a simple method to identify first-to-stop (FSTP), yellow-light running (YLR), and redlight running (RLR) cases using high-resolution data. By applying a binary logistical regression model, this research found out that occupancy time, time gap, used yellow time, time left to yellow start, time gap between the first two preceding vehicles, and decisions of preceding and surrounding vehicles show significant impacts on drivers’ decisions. Furthermore, due to the rare events nature of RLR, a modified rare events logistic regression model was developed for RLR prediction.

Further, work zones impair access to local businesses, bus stops, nearby facilities, etc., while hindering mobility of pedestrians, cyclists, and emergency responders. The emphasis on nonmotorized mobility varies significantly when temporary traffic control management plans are developed for small cities.

Bottlenecks are restrictions points along a freeway that have lower capacities than their upstream segments. In this study, the focus is on sag curves and tunnels. Using the Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel (HRBT) in Norfolk as the study site, the team developed several models to capture traffic behavior through a tunnel. An extensive literature review is conducted to document previous findings on traffic flow and control at sag curves and tunnels. It also included relevant active traffic management strategies, the use of connected vehicles to estimate the state of system, calibration of microsimulation models, and the traffic management practices for tunnels. A number of studies has been completed in the past on various technologies to manage the congestion within tunnels and strategies to estimate and improve the traffic conditions within a tunnel. Managing the length of queues and the duration of bottlenecks in the context of tunnel traffic have been investigated as well. In this project, traffic data from fixed sensors and probe vehicle data along the HRBT corridor are collected and analyzed to characterize the pertinent traffic flow phenomena. Evolution of congestion patterns and how they impact the throughput are investigated. The data are then used to calibrate a microscopic simulation model developed in VISSIM. After calibrating the model created for the HRBT, the importance of the downstream observability in absorbing shockwaves and preventing bottleneck formation within the tunnel are investigated. Reduced downstream observability (i.e., ability of the driver to observe additional vehicles ahead) due to restricted tunnel geometry is regarded as an important factor in shockwave and phantom jam generation within a tunnel which lead to bottleneck formations and a lower throughput. For testing the effect of higher downstream observability in reducing the bottleneck formation, simulation scenarios are implemented, where a percentage of cars within the traffic is assumed to have higher downstream observability. These cars are assumed to be probe cars which have higher downstream observability because of connectivity to other probe cars and the infrastructure. The results of the tests show significant travel time reductions and capacity increase at the tunnel. The research team also investigated traffic control options that could improve the throughput and delays in a typical sag curve. In particular, a control strategy based on the variable speed limit (VSL) principles is developed and simulated using an advanced car following model. Traffic flow along a sag curve is simulated using the intelligent driver model (IDM), a time-continuous car-following model. A feedback control algorithm is developed for adjusting the approach speeds of connected vehicles (CVs) so that the throughput of the sag curve is maximized. Depending on the traffic density at the sag curve, adjustments are made to the speeds of the CVs. A simulation-based optimization method using a meta-heuristic algorithm is employed to determine the critical control parameters. Various market penetration rates for CVs are also considered in the simulations. Even at relatively low market penetration rates (e.g., 5-10 %), significant improvements in travel times and throughput are observed. Additional details of this model are presented in the report.","description":"This study focuses on bottleneck formations on freeways and how connected vehicles can improve traffic flow.

The study evaluated through statistical modeling the correlation between access management practices to pedestrian crashes. Focused on the impacts of access management on pedestrian crashes, eight (8) major roadway corridors were selected and utilized for analysis. Utilizing Negative Binomial, the correlation between roadway features and pedestrian crashes were modeled. Four variables including annual average daily traffic (AADT), access density, percentage of trucks and the presence of TWLT were found to be positively associated with the pedestrian crash frequency. Variables such as the presence of median, presence of crosswalk, presence of shoulders, presence of sidewalk and high speed limit had negative coefficients hence their increase or presence tends to decrease pedestrian crashes.

This becomes more apparent at intersections, where pedestrians are unprotected and interacting with vehicles. While pedestrian phases that are commonplace at most signalized intersections facilitate their safe movement through intersections, roundabouts by nature provide little protection to pedestrians, who must judge safe gaps in traffic before crossing. This presents problems for visually impaired users, who must rely on auditory cues. The constant movement of traffic from many directions can be confusing to visually impaired pedestrians. The objective of this project is to develop a new pedestrian-activated sign that can alert drivers of the presence of pedestrians at roundabout crosswalks, in an effort to increase driver yielding behavior. A thorough literature review was performed, which investigated roadway treatments at roundabouts that improve visually impaired pedestrian safety. Given the limitations of existing studies that often put the burden of responsibility on the pedestrian, a novel pedestrian-activated yield sign was designed and an experimental design was developed for testing the effectiveness of this sign through driving simulation in combination with participant questionnaires. The goal is to determine whether drivers will intuit the meaning of the new roundabout signage after repeated exposure. Anticipated results should confirm the initial hypothesis that drivers will observe the new sign and respond by yielding to pedestrians. With multiple encounters of the new signage, an increase in yielding rates is expected compared to yielding rates associated with conventional yield signs at roundabout crossings. This study can help inform design, education, and other countermeasures for safer roundabout operations for all users.","description":"The study focuses on improving visually impaired pedestrian safety at roundabouts.

This study evaluated the application of ELRSs on rural two-lane horizontal curves. ELRSs are a variation of common shoulder rumble strips used to alert drowsy or distracted drivers when they are leaving the travel lane to the right. ELRSs are installed with the edge-line pavement marking placed directly over the rumble strip. Geometric, traffic, and crash data were obtained at treated rural two-lane horizontal curves in Kentucky and Ohio. To account for potential selection bias and regression-to-the-mean, an empirical Bayes before–after analysis was conducted using reference groups of untreated rural horizontal curves with similar characteristics to the treated sites. The analysis also controlled for changes in traffic volumes over time and time trends in crash counts unrelated to the treatment. Owing to a small sample for the reference group in Kentucky and a simultaneous statewide curve warning sign upgrade program in Ohio, alternative reference sites were used to account for annual trends.

RCUTs are also known as superstreets, J-turns, reduced conflict intersections, and synchronized streets. Previous research has shown that unsignalized RCUTs are generally safer than conventional options. However, there are no known studies specific to the safety of signalized RCUTs.

The data obtained from the study was released to the research community in 2014 through the project’s InSight webpage. The objectives of this research were to (a) explore the content of this large dataset and perform statistical analysis to identify useful performance measures to detect distracted driving behavior, and (b) provide an outline for a crash index model that can be used to quantify the crash risk associated with distracted driving behavior. Time series data on driver global positioning system (GPS) speed, lateral and longitudinal acceleration, throttle position, and yaw rate were extracted as five appropriate performance measures available from the NDS that could be used for the purpose of this research. Using this data, the objective was to detect whether a driver was engaged in one of three specific secondary tasks or no secondary task at all using the selected performance measures. The specific secondary tasks included talking or listening on a hand-held phone, texting/dialing on a hand-held phone, and driver interaction with an adjacent passenger. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the odds of a driver being engaged in one of the secondary tasks given their corresponding driving performance data. The results indicated that while none of the models provided a statistically good fit of the data, the lateral acceleration measure seemed to be a useful indicator of drivers’ engagement in talking/listening and texting/dialing on the cell phone. The analysis of distracted driving behavior for by age and gender showed slightly different results. The longitudinal acceleration variable appeared to perform better in predicting talking/listening and texting/dialing for drivers aged 70-89. The lateral acceleration measure, however, performed better in predicting the engagement of younger drivers (16-29) in the same secondary tasks. When considering the gender of drivers, the lateral acceleration performance variable proved to be more effective in predicting texting/dialing and talking/listening for both genders. Still, these results are inconclusive due to the undesirable Hosmer and Lemeshow Test p-values observed in all the models. Thus, the same analysis was performed using neural networks modeling which is recognized for its capability of nonlinear pattern recognition. The neural network analysis showed that the five performance measures can be used as surrogate measures of distracted driving. The developed neural network models also proved to be good tools for detecting drivers’ engagement in secondary tasks.

Participants knew from a practice drive that they would be asked to estimate their speed and time duration of driving, so this study used the prospective paradigm. Based on previous literature, it was expected that there would be an underestimation of time and an overestimation of speed. The reverse occurred: participants overestimated time and underestimated their speed. This suggests that drivers may have found the drive unstimulating, despite the secondary tasks, and that the rural environmental may have impacted speed perception. Additionally, a large group of participants, nine out of 34, crashed the virtual vehicle at a horizontal curve that was not problematic in previous simulator studies. When investigating these crashes further, it was found that drivers who crashed in the second drive had significantly worse time perception in the first drive than drivers who did not crash in the second drive. This finding suggests that current time perception may be a predictor of future speed selection.","description":"This study examines the effects of cognitive workload on time and speed perception in drivers.

This research tested several efficiency-focused pedestrian treatments – coordination, actuated-coordination, free operation, short cycle lengths – and safety-focused treatment including leading pedestrian intervals and Barnes Dance. Using a software-in-the-loop simulation, the operational impacts of these treatments on all users (vehicles, heavy vehicles, bicyclists and pedestrians) at an intersection were evaluated. Results showed that among the efficiency-based treatments, free operation was most beneficial for reducing minor-street pedestrian delays. Both safety treatments increased major-street vehicle delays. A new pedestrian priority algorithm is proposed and developed, which is designed to prioritize pedestrian service under certain traffic conditions. The algorithm is designed to analyze field data and change the user-defined operational strategy to match the conditions in the field. The developed algorithm was deployed at three separate locations, two of which used a Raspberry Pi device and one used the onboard logic processor of the ASC/3 controller. Before-and-after data analysis showed that the algorithm was successful in reducing pedestrian delay.

However, there is still a need to effectively and systematically address the pedestrian experience in low-income areas. A Governing analysis of pedestrian crashes found that pedestrians are fatally injured at disproportionately higher rates in the nation’s poorer neighborhoods, and in metro areas, low-income tracts record pedestrian fatality rates approximately twice those of more affluent neighborhoods. Low-income areas often are sectioned by high volume/high speed arterials, which compounds the problem. This research developed a demographics-based methodology that identifies the quantitative relationships between dependent variables such as pedestrian crashes and severe injury crashes and independent variables including demographic and social factors, road environmental factors, neighborhood land use attributes, and individual characteristics in low-income areas. For demographic and social factors, major influential variables include proportions of older adults, commuters using public transit or biking, people with a low education level, and zero-car ownership. For road environmental factors, major influential variables include number of traffic signals per census block group, number of bus stops per mile, and proportion of higher-speed roads in a census block group. For neighborhood land use attributes, major influential variables include densities of discount stores, convenience stores, and fast-food restaurants. Additionally, dark–not lighted condition is the most influential variable for severe injury in pedestrian crashes. The number of impaired pedestrians and aggressive drivers also greatly increases the probability of severe injury. Based on the demographics-based analysis and results, this study makes specific recommendations for both engineering countermeasures and pedestrian safety education/outreach plans that resonate with a given area’s demographics to effectively improve pedestrian safety in low-income areas.","description":"This study aims to address the issue of pedestrian safety in low-income areas by developing a demographics-based methodology that identifies relationships between pedestrian crashes and demographic, social, road environmental, neighborhood land use attributes, and individual characteristics.

Supplemental data items included crossing location information, route characteristics, surrounding land use and crossing enhancement descriptions. Pedestrian volume at the crossing locations was a highly desirable but unavailable data element. To characterize pedestrian activity, a method was developed to estimate ranges for pedestrian crosswalk activity levels based on the land use classification at the census block level and the presence of pedestrian traffic generators such as bus stops, schools, shopping centers and hospitals within a 0.25-mile radius. Each crosswalk was categorized into one of six levels of activity – very low, low, medium-low, medium, medium-high and high. Crash data for the 2007-2014 period were assembled for the safety analysis. After filtering, 62 pedestrian crashes and 746 rear-end crashes were retained for further analysis. The crash data were merged and analyzed. Crash patterns and risk ratios were explored. The most important trend observed was a shift (reduction) in the pedestrian crash severity after the installation of the crosswalk treatments. This shift was from fatal and injury A crash type to lower severity crashes of injury B and injury C. For pedestrian crashes, increases in the risk ratio were observed for increases in the number of lanes, the posted speed, and estimated pedestrian activity level. Similar trends were observed for rear-end crashes. Due to data limitations, subsequent safety analysis focused on installations of rectangular rapid flashing beacon (RRFB) crossing enhancements. A crash modification factor (CMF) for RRFB installations was estimated.

Stap voor stap neemt de automatisering van onze voertuigen toe, het verkeerssysteem bevindt zich in een transitie richting zelfrijdende auto’s. De automatisering biedt kansen om het verkeer veiliger, schoner en efficiënter te maken. Er ontstaan echter ook nieuwe risico’s, met name in de transitieperiode. Dit rapport beschrijft welke ontwikkelingen er worden verwacht bij de automatisering van het verkeerssysteem. Tevens wordt ingegaan op de consequenties van deze ontwikkelingen op de verkeersveiligheid: de kansen en de risico’s. Het rapport besluit met de presentatie van een onderzoeksagenda waarbij de onderwerpen zich laten clusteren tot drie groepen: 1: Interactie van de bestuurder met de nieuwe technologie in het voertuig. Dit betreft onder andere onderzoek naar (verandering in) taakbelasting, naar het schakelen tussen automatisch en handmatig rijden (‘transition of control’), naar situatiebewustzijn en gevaarherkenning tijdens (de overgang naar) het automatisch rijden, en naar de interactie van oudere automobilisten met de nieuwe technologie. 2: Interactie van (deels) geautomatiseerde voertuigen met ander verkeer. Dit betreft de interactie met andere verkeersdeelnemers en nadrukkelijk ook de interactie met kwetsbare verkeersdeelnemers. 3: Slimme infrastructuur en veiligheidseffecten op het verkeerssysteem. Dit betreft onder andere het veiligheidseffect op netwerkniveau bij gemengd verkeer met verschillende niveaus van automatisering (‘mixed traffic’), intelligente infrastructuur en voertuigcommunicatie (V2X) en ‘leesbare’ wegen (‘roads that cars can read’). SWOV beoogt op deze onderwerpen, eventueel in samenwerking met andere organisaties, door middel van onderzoek substantieel en herkenbaar bij te dragen aan de verbetering van de verkeersveiligheid tijdens de transitie naar hogere niveaus van automatisering.

All these factors highlight the need to develop a traffic warning signal to protect pedestrians and bicyclists at intersections. Therefore, a supplemental traffic signal has been proposed to warn the left-turning driver about crossing pedestrians and bicyclists at intersections. This signal will be activated when the pedestrian pushes a call button or when a bicyclist has been detected by a detection loop. The aim of this supplemental traffic signal is to enhance pedestrian and bicyclist detection by warning drivers who are focusing their attention on finding a gap in the oncoming traffic. A number of different supplemental warning traffic signal designs were proposed, and the evaluation of their designs was split into two stages. Stage 1 involved a screening tool to eliminate weak designs that are confusing or have poor legibility by asking drivers how well each design conveys the message. After collecting and analyzing 259 responses, results showed that two designs, identified throughout the report as Design 1 and Design 3, were ranked the highest. Design 1 is a supplemental yellow pedestrian warning indication. Design 3 is a modified version of an R10-15 Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) sign. Stage 2 involved an open-ended question survey that asked subjects to interpret the meaning of Design 1 and Design 3. A total of 145 responses were collected in Stage 2. An analysis of Stage 2 responses found Design 3 to be the most promising design for communicating the presence of conflicting pedestrians to left-turning drivers. Findings from the survey process will facilitate the evaluation of the scenarios on a driving-simulator platform by narrowing the conditions and factors tested during the experiment.","description":"The study aims to evaluate countermeasures to improve pedestrian and bicycle safety at intersections.

A new paper - written for the RAC Foundation by Professor Teresa Senserrick of the University of New South Wales and Neale Kinnear of TRL - asks whether we need a new approach to try and tackle the issue. While all new drivers (whatever their age) are at increased risk of a crash when first starting to drive independently, young drivers are also affected by age-related influences related to the stage of their development. These include the well-recognised heightening of sensation-seeking and peer influences, but also the less well-known vulnerability to distractions and fatigue. The paper argues that it is time to stop thinking about ‘problem’ young drivers and adopt a broader, more comprehensive approach to improving young driver safety, which goes beyond simply blaming individuals, and proposes a systems-based approach to young driver safety which looks at the social and environmental factors that put young drivers at risk. It argues that there must be an evidence-based approach to managing known risk factors - like driving at night and with peer-passengers - that everyone involved in the development of new drivers can support. The paper advocates looking again at the successes achieved by different forms of graduated licensing introduced around the world. Encouraging young people to use public transport at night and greater parental support during the early years of license-holding, for example, are ways to indirectly reduce young driver crash rates.","description":"Young drivers in Great Britain are consistently over-represented in crashes, a problem that persists despite numerous pre- and post-test initiatives.

A new paper - written for the RAC Foundation by Professor Teresa Senserrick of the University of New South Wales and Neale Kinnear of TRL - asks whether we need a new approach to try and tackle the issue. While all new drivers (whatever their age) are at increased risk of a crash when first starting to drive independently, young drivers are also affected by age-related influences related to the stage of their development. These include the well-recognised heightening of sensation-seeking and peer influences, but also the less well-known vulnerability to distractions and fatigue. The paper argues that it is time to stop thinking about ‘problem’ young drivers and adopt a broader, more comprehensive approach to improving young driver safety, which goes beyond simply blaming individuals, and proposes a systems-based approach to young driver safety which looks at the social and environmental factors that put young drivers at risk. It argues that there must be an evidence-based approach to managing known risk factors - like driving at night and with peer-passengers - that everyone involved in the development of new drivers can support. The paper advocates looking again at the successes achieved by different forms of graduated licensing introduced around the world. Encouraging young people to use public transport at night and greater parental support during the early years of license-holding, for example, are ways to indirectly reduce young driver crash rates.","description":"The paper addresses the issue of young and novice-driver safety in Great Britain, highlighting the need for a systems-based approach to tackle the problem.

Also, transportation as a sector is a significant component of any national economy, and has far-reaching implications both with regard to socio-economic and environmental well-being of the society and within the context of sustainability science. For this reason, sustainable transportation is not only an important field of research within the academia but also an indispensable constituent of a sustainable economy. Therefore, investigating the path to sustainable transportation requires a holistic approach, encompassing the three dimensions of sustainability, i.e. environment, society, and economy. There are several proposals as to how to transition to a more sustainable transportation sector globally, and one of the most promising options is the electrification of vehicles. Hence, it is crucial to look at the electrification of transportation from different angles, and scrutinize different aspects to this matter. This project developed several integrated sustainability assessment models that include the socio-economic as well as the environmental implications of an electrified transportation sector. These developed models covered a wide variety of means and aspects of an electrified transportation such as passenger vehicles, electric vehicle (EVs) market penetration, electric buses and long-haul trucks, vehicle to grid (V2G) technology that included delivery trucks, and the potential use of electric vehicles as a source of energy both for the grid and homes, i.e. vehicle to home technology (V2H). In the modeling, consideration was applied to stochastic costs, electricity mix sustainability, and life cycle impacts such as environmental, e.g. life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, social, e.g. life cycle health costs, and economic, e.g. life cycle costs. Indepth comparison between electric vehicles and other alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) (incl. hybrid-electric, plug-in hybrid-electric, liquefied-natural gas, compressed-natural gas, biodiesel-powered vehicles) was carried out to investigate the major advantages and/or disadvantages of electrifying different means and types of transportation, e.g. passenger vehicles, transit buses, and long-haul trucks. The final output was a dynamic simulation models of EV adoption that included a comprehensive cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment including uncertainties that capture the social, economic, and environmental impacts of EVs. Some of the critical findings of this project are as follows: Environmental benefits of EVs highly depend on  the electricity generation mix; battery-electric transit and school buses have larger battery capacity than passenger vehicles, making them more feasible candidates for V2G service; there is an enormous potential to neutralize operation related emissions by the use of V2G service for school buses and delivery trucks; battery-electric Class 8 trucks yield important improvements in terms of life-cycle costs, life-cycle emissions, and life-cycle air pollution externalities; buildings and EVs can be considered together in term of energy supply and consumption; and V2H technology can drastically reduce the cost of electricity through storing electricity in the battery during off-peak hours and deplete it during on-peak hours.","description":"This project aimed to investigate the socio-economic implications of large-scale electric vehicle systems.

While the scale of these benefits can be predicted theoretically, a more accurate measurement will be provided from a road trial, which also provides important information on practical issues and on interactions with existing infrastructure and other vehicles. In order to have a robust understanding of the benefits and issues of convoying/platooning for heavy vehicles, a trial involving the participation of key stakeholders is the only practical way to collect or validate the required information. In principle, a road trial would generate reliable information for an impact assessment, which will then enable the evaluation of appropriate policies with respect to semi-autonomous or autonomous platooning. However, as well as providing a way of measuring the benefits and investigating logistical issues, carrying out a trial on the public road carries a paramount responsibility to ensure a high level of safety. Consequently, a thorough and independent assessment of issues and risks and their appropriate mitigation actions is essential. This feasibility study aims to identify and assess the main issues relating to a road trial of HGV convoying/platooning technology on UK motorways and provide a clear and independent assessment, highlighting the data required to inform an impact assessment, the risks of running a road trial, their appropriate mitigating measures, and to clearly identify any risks or issues that cannot be mitigated or which have residual risk.","description":"The study examines the feasibility of deploying heavy vehicle platoons on UK motorways, focusing on semi‑autonomous and autonomous convoying technologies.

The paper stresses the importance of ensuring high safety standards during public‑road testing and calls for a thorough, independent assessment of risks and mitigation strategies. The ultimate goal is to generate reliable data for impact assessment and policy evaluation regarding platooning on UK roads.","objective":"The primary objective is to identify and evaluate the main issues associated with conducting a heavy vehicle platooning trial on UK motorways. The study seeks to provide an independent assessment of potential risks and their mitigation measures. It aims to delineate the data required to inform a comprehensive impact assessment of platooning technology. By doing so, it intends to support the development of appropriate policies for semi‑autonomous or autonomous platooning. The research also aims to highlight any risks that cannot be fully mitigated or that will remain residual after mitigation. Ultimately, the study seeks to establish a robust foundation for future road trials and policy decisions.","method":"The study adopts a feasibility‑analysis approach, systematically identifying potential issues, risks, and data requirements for a heavy vehicle platooning trial. It conducts an independent assessment of safety and logistical concerns, proposing mitigation actions where possible.

The current AASHTO-LRFD (2012) specification recommends designing a bridge pier vulnerable to vehicular impacts for an equivalent static force of 600 kips (2,670 kN) applied in a horizontal plane at a distance of 5.0 feet above the ground level. This report presents a performance-based approach for designing a bridge pier subject to impact by a tractor-semi-trailer weighing up to 80,000 lb based on an extensive experimental and computational investigation. The mechanics and modes of failure of bridge pier bents during vehicular impacts are investigated through two pendulum impact tests on a large scale physical model of a three-column bent system. The parameters of the computational model are calibrated to these two tests and further validated through comparisons to other published small-scale impact tests. Through extensive numerical simulation of heavy vehicle (tractor-semitrailer) impacts on piers, the impact force time histories are proposed in the form of analytical triangular pulse functions. The parameters of these functions are derived through numerical regression based on the simulation results. A performance-based approach that relates demands (in terms of the applied force time histories) and capacity (in terms of acceptable shear distortion and plastic rotation) is proposed for the design of bridge piers vulnerable to heavy vehicle impact. Since many collision failures have been observed to be dominated by shear failure, the proposed performance-based approach uses capacity design concepts from earthquake engineering to mitigate collapse by minimizing shear distortion of piers impacted by heavy vehicles.","description":"This report presents a performance-based approach for designing bridge piers subject to impact by heavy vehicles.

The bus was occupied by the driver and about 12 student passengers, who were on their way to Challenger Elementary School in Thief River Falls. The bus had been traveling north, but the driver missed a scheduled stop and turned around to pick up a 7-year-old boy and his two siblings (ages 13 and 11) who were waiting on the east side of the highway (ordinarily, the boarding side for their bus).

According to the American Transportation Research Institute, fuel costs alone amounted to about 25 percent of truck operating costs in 2015. Within the U.S. on-road transportation sector HDVs consume a disproportionately high amount of the total refined petroleum-based fuel and carbon dioxide emissions from consumption of this fuel were estimated to be equivalent to over 400 million metric tons. HDVs also contributed a disproportionately high 2.5 million short tons of Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) emissions, emitted as a by-product of fuel combustion in on-road vehicle engines. NOx is a precursor of ozone, which is an air pollutant harmful to humans, plants, and animals. Over the next couple of decades, the total energy demand from the HDV sector will likely increase due to forecasted growth in freight demand in many global markets, including the United States, and much of this energy will continue to be provided by fossil fuels. Therefore, carbon dioxide emissions from the HDV sector are also expected to increase in the absence of effective mitigating measures to reduce the sectors reliance on fossil fuels. In this study, the authors develop a tool to predict the fleet-wide fuel-saving benefits from low rolling resistance tires. Unlike previous studies, the developed tool is applicable to both stabilized speed operations and transient speed operations. The tool is based on empirical models that estimate the fuel consumption contribution from tires as a function of vehicle payload, aerodynamic drag, road grade, duration of acceleration, duration of deceleration and, and road facility type (freeway, major arterial, and minor arterial/local road). The authors limited the scope of the developed tool to tractor-trailers in the U.S. heavy-duty vehicle market, because the United States has the second largest HDV market in the world and tractor-trailers account for the largest share of the market.

Cycling contributes to the society by reducing fuel consumption, traffic congestion, and air and noise pollution. In recent days, cycling has been promoted as more emphasis is given to non-motorized mobility. To attract people towards cycling, safe and comfortable bikeways are needed. The impact of bikeway design parameters on bicycle stability (safety) and rider comfort can be evaluated using simulation models. Therefore, a dynamic simulation model is developed in ADAMS using the Whipple benchmark bicycle model parameters. Vertical equilibrium, theoretical centripetal acceleration, and experimental data collected using an instrumented probe bicycle (IPB) are used to validate the model. The bicycle model is simulated over a predefined horizontally curved bikeway at different velocities to calculate slip angle, centripetal acceleration and jerk. The results show that the slip angle, centripetal acceleration and jerk increase with the increase of bicycle velocity and degree of curvature. Depending on the available transition curves, a significant jerk could be generated at the entrance and exit of a curve. As the outcome of this research, a graphical tool is presented that can be used to determine the upper limit of the velocity for a given horizontal curve to limit the jerk. Alternatively, this tool can be used to determine the jerk in order to design transition curves for a given horizontal curve and a selected velocity","description":"A dynamic simulation model of a bicycle was developed to assess how bikeway design parameters influence rider safety and comfort.

Therefore, there is a continuing need to expand opportunities to reduce crashes by applying new technologies. Sponsored by Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), this project successfully evaluated video-analytic freeway WWD detection systems currently on the market from three vendors, regarding their capabilities for real-time WWD vehicle detection and Traffic Management Center (TMC) notification. In this project, in addition to actual WWD vehicles, traffic of inside-lane driving in the opposite direction (IDOD) was treated as WWD traffic under certain data collection scenarios for WWD detection to ensure sufficient data size. Six testing locations were selected on I-275 segment between I-4 and I-75 in the Tampa Bay area, and these testing locations were assigned to one of four testing scenarios: (1) testing with normal daily traffic conditions; (2) testing consecutive WWD in both directions; (3) testing under normal light nighttime traffic conditions; and (4) testing under low light nighttime traffic conditions. Real-time WWD incident detection and data collection were conducted through fixed camera videos streams at these locations. A series of performance measures was defined to evaluate the performance of the WWD detection systems from three vendors, including (1) WWD detection system accuracy; (2) percentage of false calls; (3) actual WWD detection accuracy; and (4) percentage of missed calls. In addition, the capabilities of candidate systems on TMC notification were tested by collecting email notification data. The data review and analysis results revealed that (1) WWD is a very rare traffic incident, as there were no actual WWD vehicles detected in real traffic during the one-week data collection period; (2) in all three testing scenarios, including testing of consecutive WWD vehicles in both directions, testing under normal light nighttime traffic conditions, and testing under low light nighttime traffic conditions, researchers found that the system from Vendor 1 showed the best performance at an overall 95% detection system accuracy and 94% actual detection accuracy, followed by the systems from Vendor 2 and Vendor 3; (3) system performance from the three vendors on WWD detection varied significantly, indicating that performance of real-time video-analytic freeway WWD detection systems highly depends on the individual vendor’s system; (4) analysis of TMC notification data revealed that all three candidate systems were able to send an email notification if a WWD was detected. The evaluation results and findings from this research project are informative and can be used to support FDOT and other state DOTs in future implementations of WWD detection systems on freeways and limited-access facilities.","description":"This research project evaluated the performance of three video-analytic freeway wrong-way driving (WWD) detection systems from different vendors.

In this study, the authors consider the use of video cameras to monitor pedestrian traffic in settings where a static camera that has an unobstructed view of the road is used to detect and track pedestrians. In previous research efforts, the authors addressed the detection and placement of pedestrians present at the intersection. This effort focused on the prediction aspects of the monitoring process. In particular, the authors focused on creating interaction models that take into account influences among other agents in the scene (i.e. other pedestrians), rather than independent models for each single agent. A heuristic-based algorithm was developed to predict pedestrian trajectories. In addition, predictions must be generated in real time to be useful. Therefore, the last objective of this work was producing a software implementation capable of generating predictions in real time. The work conducted in this project moves us closer to deploying systems for detecting, tracking, and forecasting human behavior in dynamic environments. This information can be used by other systems as part of an infrastructure-based framework to effectively protect pedestrians: the more vulnerable traffic participants.","description":"Intersections often lack real‑time awareness of pedestrian traffic, with existing infrastructure primarily detecting vehicles at specific points.

However, it includes only a simplistic method for predicting the number of bicycle-related crashes. The research team investigated the bicycle-specific crash data in eight potential study areas around the U.S.: Arlington, VA; Bellingham, WA; Boulder, CO; Denver, CO; Minneapolis and St. Paul, MN; Philadelphia, PA; Portland, OR; and San Diego, CA. The available online data from each were compared. The study city for future analysis (Boulder) was selected based on the availability of not just crash data but also the availability of continuous and short-duration bicycle and pedestrian traffic count data. In this analysis, a negative binomial model with log link was used to predict annual, non-fatal, motorist-bicyclist crashes on road segments per mile. This report adopts methods from the HSM used for motor vehicle safety performance functions (SPFs) in order to develop bicycle specific SPFs for roadway segments in Boulder. The analysis shows that motor vehicle volume is a leading factor associated with more crashes between motor vehicles and bicyclists. Bicyclist exposure, population density, and percent retail land use are also predictive. While both vehicle volume and bicycle volume data are used in the model in order to account for the “safety in numbers” effect, the model did not demonstrate this effect that is seen so commonly in other research, including the bicycle SPF developed previously for intersections in Boulder. This effort at developing a bicycle-specific SPF for segments in the U.S. that utilize bicycle volumes is an important first step towards further understanding bicyclist safety and may inform future versions of the HSM. To that end, the report includes a table of motorist-cyclist crashes predicted by the model for various values. The authors hope this table may serve as a potential format template and starting point for future efforts to generalize the results of models for possible use in HSM updates.","description":"The study aims to improve bicycle crash prediction for urban road segments by developing a bicycle-specific safety performance function (SPF) using data from Boulder, CO.

Advanced knowledge about the presence of these users on the roadway is particularly important when their presence is not expected or when these users are out of range of the advanced safety systems that are becoming a standard feature in vehicles today. For example, having advanced knowledge of a pedestrian walking along a rural roadway is key to increasing driver awareness through in-vehicle warning messages that provide an augmented version of the roadway ahead. As connected vehicles start to enter the market, it is conceivable that when the vehicle sensors detect a pedestrian on a rural roadway, the pedestrian presence can be communicated to vehicles upstream of the pedestrian location that have not reached the destination. As part of the research presented, an experiment was conducted in which the detection of pedestrians by subjects was tested with and without an advanced warning about the pedestrian presence ahead. For comparison purposes, in addition to testing the detection of pedestrians as a result of advanced warning messages on rural roadways, the same situation was tested on urban roadways.","description":"The paper explores how augmented reality (AR) can improve safety at pedestrian-vehicle interactions by providing drivers with advanced knowledge of vulnerable road users.

Applying CurveFinder to datasets from multiple states has revealed the need to improve the accuracy of CurveFinder for low-quality datasets that contain errors or do not represent the actual roadway alignment accurately. States also expressed the need to obtain curve information compatible with Federal Highway Administration’s Model Inventory of Roadway Elements (MIRE). The goal of this IDEA project is to:  incorporate the ability in CurveFinder to extract curve-related MIRE elements; improve the accuracy of CurveFinder for low-quality GIS data sources; and develop an online portal called CurvePortal where agencies can upload their GIS roadway maps for obtaining horizontal curve location and geometric information.  MIRE has a specific subcategory for horizontal curve data, and includes eight elements. The updated CurveFinder extracts all MIRE elements from GIS roadway maps except for Element 111 Superelevation, which can only be obtained from field surveys. For each curve extracted by CurveFinder, information on curve type, curve degree, curve radius, curve length, whether there is a presence of transition section, the deflection angle if the curve is a horizontal angle point, and the curve direction is included as attributes in the GIS shapefile.  CurveFinder preparation, calibration, and run for production of final results has been streamlined into a five step process. To improve the accuracy of CurveFinder for low-quality GIS datasets, two smoothing methods are used to preprocess the data before applying the CurveFinder algorithm. Calibration is performed within desktop GIS software by an iterative process by which the original road segments as well as smoothed road features by means of best fit and spline methods with a variety of offset and angle thresholds are passed to the curve finder algorithm. The preprocessing and calibration steps resulted in better identification of the start and end points of curves as demonstrated by the increased coverage of identified curves as compared to ground truth curves.  CurvePortal was developed to serve as an intuitive web interface by which users can upload spatial road features as well as optionally define an attribute field on which distinct road segments participating in a given roadway can be joined. Additionally, the interface offers the option to upload ground truth features that can be used for calibration purposes and identification of optimal algorithm parameters prior to the final curve identification step.","description":"The CurveFinder tool is used to automatically identify horizontal curves and extract their geometric characteristics from geographic information system (GIS) roadway maps.

Stabilization is enforced by law, regulation, and a permit system. Stabilization is most efficiently attained by reestablishment of vegetation, and permits sometimes specify this method of stabilization. Revegetation is difficult in northern Alaska, and seeded grasses often die in a year or two, while reestablishment with native vegetation takes several years. A literature search and interviews with experts indicates that simply extending this “establishment period” has many practical difficulties. Field investigations and interviews indicate that in northern Alaska little erosion occurs at slopes with failed vegetation, which implies that vegetation was not critical to reducing contamination and the expense of revegetation was unnecessary. However, when revegetation is specified in standard permit language, and contractor, owner, and regulator must close out projects, grasses are utilized. This research supports the recommendation that the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities work with the Alaska Department of Natural Resources and the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation to develop special standards for projects north of the Brooks Range and between the Brooks and Alaska ranges, that recognize the low erosion potential of clean road fill – embankments.","description":"Highway construction in northern Alaska disturbs soil, creating a risk of sediment migration into water bodies. Legal and regulatory frameworks mandate slope stabilization, often specifying vegetation as the preferred method. However, revegetation with seeded grasses is unreliable in the region, with many plants dying within a year or two, and native species take several years to establish. A literature review and expert interviews suggest that simply extending the establishment period is impractical. Field studies reveal that slopes lacking vegetation experience minimal erosion, indicating that vegetation may not be essential for contamination control. Despite this, permit language frequently requires revegetation, compelling contractors to plant grasses. The study therefore examines the necessity of vegetation-based stabilization and proposes tailored standards for northern Alaska.","objective":"The research seeks to determine whether vegetation is critical for long-term slope stability on disturbed highway sites in northern Alaska. It evaluates the effectiveness of current stabilization practices and the practicality of revegetation under local climatic conditions.

By comparing erosion outcomes on vegetated versus non‑vegetated slopes, the research intends to inform more efficient stabilization strategies. Ultimately, it seeks to recommend region‑specific standards that reduce unnecessary costs while maintaining environmental protection.","method":"A comprehensive literature search was conducted to gather existing knowledge on slope stabilization and revegetation in northern Alaska.

Most roadway design and traffic control strategies on horizontal curves include limited considerations for motorcycles. It is necessary to conduct a study to investigate the factors contributing to motorcycle crash risk on horizontal curves and identify effective countermeasures to improve motorcycle safety. This project aimed to fill the gap by completing the following four tasks: 1. A comprehensive literature review to summarize current practices of preventing motorcycle crashes on horizontal curves; 2. A crash analysis to address relevant factors and how to influence motorcycle crash risk on horizontal curves, including crash occurrence, risk of fatalities and severe injuries, and motorcyclist-at-fault; 3. A field experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of Dynamic Speed Feedback Signs (DSFS) to reduce motorcycle speed and increase motorcyclist attention on curve risk; 4. A before-after crash analysis to address the effectiveness of DSFS in motorcycle crash reduction on horizontal curves; 5. Recommendations to address the identified curve-related safety issues for motorcycles in Florida and prevent motorcycle injury on horizontal curves. Advanced statistical models were used to analyze 11 years (2005–2015) of motorcycle crashes data collected on curves on Florida roadways. Crash Modification Factors (CMFs) of curve radius and curve type for single-motorcycle crashes on rural two-lane highways were developed. The CMFs can be used in Highway Safety Manual (HSM)-compatible motorcycle safety management. Significant factors contributing to motorcycle crash frequency, severity, and motorcyclist-at-fault on horizontal curves were also identified and quantified. A field behavior experiment collected speed profile data and eyetracking data from 10 participants with different DSFS operation modes (“OFF” – without DSFS, “STATIC” – continuously display speed limit, “DYNAMIC” – feedback scheme with flashing and “SLOW DOWN” display). The results indicate that DSFS in “DYNAMIC” mode can effectively increase motorcyclist attention on curves and intention to reduce speed. The before-after with comparison group study shows that the implementation of DSFS on rural two-lane undivided curves can reduce lane departure motorcycle crashes by 22%. Based on the analysis results, recommendations were developed for increasing awareness of curve risks, decreasing speed, roadside clearance, implementation of DSFS, and education/training.","description":"This study aimed to investigate the factors contributing to motorcycle crash risk on horizontal curves and identify effective countermeasures to improve motorcycle safety.

Our models for such intersections are stochastic in nature to capture the inherent uncertainty about future arrivals of vehicles and their characteristics such as inter-vehicle-type heterogeneity (due to the vehicle’s features, in particular the size and acceleration speed of the vehicle), inter-driver heterogeneity (due to the driver characteristics such as age, gender, years of driving experience), intra-driver heterogeneity (due to the driver’s behavior in different situations), etc. In this thesis, these intersections are modeled by mathematical stochastic models, so-called gap-acceptance models in the framework of queueing theory. The basis of these models is the assumption that the crossing decision of a driver on the minor road is based on the time gap between two successive vehicles on the major road. These models can also be applied in other contexts as well, e.g. when analyzing freeways and pedestrian crossings. Specifically, we study a single server queueing model with batch arrivals and semi-Markov service times to investigate performance measures on the minor road such as the capacity, the queue length distribution and the delay distribution, and show the impact of the gap-acceptance strategy and the merging behavior of low-priority drivers on these performance measures.

The motorcoach was part of a two-motorcoach chartered tour operated by First Class Tours & Charters of Houston, Texas, which was transporting students from Channelview High School, who were returning to Houston from a trip to Disney World in Orlando, Florida. At the crash location, I-10 is a four-lane divided highway with a posted speed limit of 70 mph; its eastbound and westbound travel lanes are divided by an earthen center median. The weather conditions were reported as dry and clear. The crash event began when the 2018 Prevost motorcoach departed the westbound lanes at a shallow angle of about 5 degrees, crossed the center median, traveled into and across the opposing eastbound travel lanes and onto the far eastbound shoulder, striking the guardrail adjacent to the south shoulder of the roadway. The guardrail redirected the motorcoach, which went back across the eastbound travel lanes and returned to the center median. After traveling for more than a quarter-mile (1,561 feet) off its intended course, the motorcoach—now traveling roughly westbound in the median—drove off the roadway and fell into the Cowpen Creek ravine, which was spanned by two separate bridges for the eastbound and westbound I-10 roadways. As a result of the crash, the motorcoach driver received fatal injuries, and all 46 motorcoach passengers were injured; 15 passengers sustained serious injuries and 31 passengers sustained minor injuries. ​The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the motorcoach roadway departure and crash into a ravine near Loxley, Alabama, was the incapacitation of the driver due to an unknown medical event.","description":"On March 13, 2018, a 2018 Prevost 56‑passenger motorcoach traveling westbound on Interstate 10 near Loxley, Alabama, departed its lane at a shallow angle and crossed the center median.

The driver and his passengers were on their way to the driver’s residence from a nearby shopping mall, a trip of about 4 miles.  In this area, Seabreeze Boulevard consists of two northbound and two southbound lanes divided by a center turn lane. The posted speed limit is 30 mph. At the crash location, the roadway curves to the left for southbound traffic. The approach to the curve has a turn-warning sign indicating that the roadway turns left, augmented by a flashing beacon and a posted advisory speed of 25 mph.  According to witnesses, the driver had maneuvered the car into the left lane and was passing another vehicle. The driver lost control while moving back into the right lane as he attempted to negotiate the curve. As the car exited the curve, it struck and mounted the curb on the west side of the road, crossed the sidewalk, and continued south, striking a wall on the north side of a residential driveway. The car continued forward and struck the wall on the south side of the driveway. Witnesses reported that flames came from the car after the second collision.

Distractions such as walking while looking at electronic devices are the third leading cause of fatalities and recent research has shown that injuries from distracted walking have increased 81% since 2005. The introduction of self-driving cars could further complicate this problem as illustrated by the death of a pedestrian caused by an Uber self-driving car in 2018. To examine how well an electronic alerting device installed on a smartphone could prevent distracted pedestrians from making unsafe or risky crossings, an experiment was conducted in an actual controlled field setting. Using a smartphone with a remotely-controlled alerting system, thirty participants performed thirty crossings each while walking and playing a game on the smartphone. In addition to just-in-time alerts, two-thirds of participants were presented with early and late alerts which constituted 80% and 90% alarm reliabilities. Out of 900 crossing events, 20% of crossings were risky or unsafe. More than 18% of participants exhibited underestimation bias and thought the car was farther away than it really was. While international participants (i.e., non-US-born) as a group were more likely to attempt risky crossings while engaged in distracted walking, they also trusted the alert less when it generated early and late warnings. These results suggest that national origin may play an important role in the use of technological interventions meant to promote positive behaviors and that a solution effective in one setting may not generalize to other nations. Moreover, technology interventions like smartphone-based alerts do not produce substantially safer pedestrian behaviors than those observed in populations without such tools. While the subject pool was small in this study, this research suggests that there may be design criteria that can be elucidated from such use of machine learning classification methods in concert with controlled experiments.","description":"The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an electronic alerting device installed on a smartphone in preventing distracted pedestrians from making unsafe or risky crossings.

Distracted driving data from naturalistic observation, roadside observation, self-report studies and crash data were examined. The reviewed studies suggested that any distraction that takes the driver’s eyes from the forward roadway significantly increases the risk of having a crash, as do cognitive distractions, including emotional distress. Consequently, many different types of distracted driving behaviours need to be considered in addition to mobile phone use with other distracted driving behaviours shown to be as prevalent, or more prevalent, than mobile phone use. The literature indicated drivers of all ages continue to engage in distracting behaviours despite their self-reported awareness or perceptions of the associated dangers and their increased crash risk, with the immediate benefits of engaging in a distracted driving behaviour viewed as outweighing the risks. Additionally, some distracted drivers attempt to compensate for their distracted driving behaviour or to conceal their behaviour, which increases their level of distraction and may exacerbate the level of risk (e.g. hiding their mobile phone below the window so it cannot be seen by police). This review highlighted the dangers associated with hands-free phone use while driving, and the risk that laws abolishing only hand-held phone may give drivers a false sense of security when engaging in this behaviour.

The actuation of pedestrian “Walk” signal indications at signalized intersections and the triggering of rectangular rapid flash beacons (RRFBs) or high-intensity activated crosswalks (HAWKs) at midblock crosswalks, require a pedestrian to push a button. However, 40%–50% of pedestrians of pedestrians do not push the button. The Center for Urban Transportation Research (CUTR), in close coordination with the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), researched automatic pedestrian detection systems for use at midblock crosswalks to automatically activate the RRFBs, and at signalized intersections to automatically place a pedestrian call to the traffic signal controller. The CUTR research team reviewed various automatic pedestrian detection systems for their functionality and performance. Three systems were selected for this research. They were first tested under controlled conditions, and at midblock and intersection locations. One of the three systems was able to meet all desired performance requirements. This system was further deployed and evaluated at two midblock crosswalks and one signalized intersection. The evaluation results showed that the system produced an overall 92% detection system accuracy at midblock locations, with only 2% false detections. The system was able to detect pedestrians 94% of the time and place a pedestrian service call 90% of the time at a signalized intersection. An important contribution of this research project is the work conducted to connect the automatic pedestrian detection systems to a traffic signal controller to place a pedestrian call when a pedestrian is detected and to remove the call when the pedestrian walks out of the detection zone prematurely before the call is served. Testing showed that the system was able to detect the disappearance of pedestrians 98% of the time and removed the pedestrian call 97% of the time when they left the detection zone early. This result showed the capability of the automatic detection system and the advanced traffic signal controller with a custom script to administer removal of a pedestrian call when it is not needed.

The overall results indicated that three pedestrian feature signs—“Right on Red after Stop,” “Turning Vehicles Yield to Pedestrians,” and “Stop Here on Red”—showed large increases of driver compliance after their implementation when compared to those before implementation. The increases of driver compliance after the implementation of “Right Turn on Red after Stop” signs for right-turning vehicles, “Stop Here on Red,” signs, and “Turning Vehicles Yield to Pedestrians” blank-out signs were all statistically significant at a confidence level of 95%.

Arterial corridors with heavy use by commercial vehicles often suffer from poor operational performance, either because they were not designed considering the current level of commercial truck traffic or the analysis tools used for such design did not properly account for the effect of commercial vehicles. The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) provides one of the most commonly used analysis methods for arterial corridors, and it employs a methodology that does not properly account for the full vehicle dynamics of heavy vehicles. To improve on this shortcoming in the HCM calculations, this project makes use of a microsimulation tool, which takes into account advanced vehicle acceleration modeling of heavy vehicles. The field data were obtained by setting up cameras, data from which were used as the basis of calibrating the microsimulation tool. To develop recommendations, synthetic data were generated using this tool, and experimental design scenarios were set up. These scenarios were tested against both the microsimulation tool and HCM, and comparisons were made of the obtained results from both tools. Regression models were developed to provide recommendations for Florida to adjust saturation flow rate and running time calculations. These models were developed with the intent that the usage of these models will result in more accurate signalized arterial design in Florida, compared to solely using the current HCM methodologies. The major benefit for Florida through this study is the development of adjusted calculations of the HCM urban streets and signalized intersections methodologies so they do not overestimate running speeds and saturation flow rates. This will positively affect signalized arterial corridor planning in Florida and may positively impact the state’s freight signal priority goals and interests.","description":"This study focuses on the impacts of commercial heavy vehicles on signalized arterial corridor performance in Florida.

The researchers conducted performance evaluations at 24 unique field sites that had 51 treatments, and at a test deck that had 12 different variations of audible markings. The field sites consisted of varying designs and spacing of audible markings, rumble bars, and milled rumble strips. A crash study was conducted that considered 77 treatment sites and appropriate comparison sites. The field performance study found that the performance was somewhat variable, but the alternative treatments could produce noise and vibration levels similar to milled rumble strips. The crash study showed that the installed treatments reduced total crashes by about 19 percent across all the sites considered (30 percent reduction in fatal and injury crashes). These sites had a minimum of at least one treatment on either the edge line or the center line. Audible markings and rumble bars are viable alternative lane departure warning treatments from a noise and vibration performance standpoint, from a crash reduction standpoint, and a benefit-cost ratio (at least 11:1) standpoint.

The objective of the IMM project is to provide accurate and actionable data to government officials and transit advocates. The meter is an expansion of the Technologies for Safe and Efficient Transportation University Transportation Center (UTC T-SET) funded project “Automatic Counting of Pedestrians and Cyclists”, which researched, developed and deployed a robust pedestrian and bike counting system. The deployed system was employed - in collaboration with the City of Pittsburgh - to collect usage data on Pittsburgh’s bike lanes. However current system capabilities are limited to counting pedestrians and bikes. To create a true mobility meter, this project expanded the analysis capabilities to counting motor vehicles. For purposes of obtaining the counts of objects moving in a given direction at a location, the problem statement is broken down into three different technical objectives: (1) Generate consistent detections of cars, pedestrians and bicycles in each frame of the video as they move through the field of view of the camera; (2) Once detected, accurately track each of these objects - cars, bikes and pedestrians by assigning a unique ID for each object as soon as the objects appear in the field of view of the camera; (3) Use all the tracks obtained by the detected objects to determine the total counts of the objects passing through a location in different directions.","description":"The Intelligent Mobility Meter (IMM) is a portable platform designed to capture fine‑grained traffic statistics for pedestrians, cyclists, and motor vehicles.

These objectives collectively aim to create a true mobility meter that captures multimodal traffic dynamics. The data produced will inform infrastructure investment, safety assessments, and mobility policy decisions.","method":"The IMM employs a camera‑based video capture system that continuously records traffic scenes. In each frame, computer vision algorithms detect cars, pedestrians, and bicycles, ensuring consistent identification across time.

To meet the mandatory reductions in CO₂ by 15% in 2025 and 30% in 2030 manufacturers must improve fuel-efficiency for HDVs at a faster rate than in the past. Also, by the end of 2022, the European Commission must consider additional elements omitted from the first phase of the standards. Some of these include providing incentives towards zero-emission trucks, the introduction of CO₂ reduction targets for 2035 and 2040, and the inclusion of additional vehicle types. The authors note the challenges that the CO₂ standards create and make recommendations towards timely solutions. The main findings are: 1) Certification of hybrid HDVs can be achieved in two steps. A simple simulation covering only parallel hybrid vehicles can enable the certification of models close to production. More accurate test methods can be developed in a second step. Powertrain testing is recommended as a widely applicable methodology for certification. 2) Electric vehicle range certification should be a priority, as it is a prerequisite for the development of effective incentives in sectors where electrification is difficult. 3) Waste heat recovery (WHR) is a robust technology nearly ready for deployment. The present certification methodology partially covers WHR systems, but with several limitations. Cycle-average mapping, developed in the United States, is proposed as a certification option that overcomes some of these limitations. 4) Trailer CO₂ certification is necessary to encourage new trailer technologies and to include trailers as a future category in the CO₂ standards. To ease the burden on manufacturers, a simple regulatory design that accurately estimates CO₂ reductions from trailers is desirable. 5) Credits for innovative technology can be a useful incentive in the development and adoption of technologies not yet covered by the certification. Such credits should be regarded as a step toward implementation in the CO₂ certification framework.","description":"The European Union has adopted standards for carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions by heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs), requiring manufacturers to improve fuel-efficiency at a faster rate than in the past.

While national guidelines such as the Model Minimum Uniform Crash Criteria (MMUCC) standardize definitions and data elements, the degree to which states have adopted the MMUCC guidelines/data elements regarding work zone crashes varies considerably across states. About 50% of states include 4 or more of the MMUCC’s work zone data elements (C18), while the remaining include 3 or less. Because these elements reflect the “minimum model standard,” it is reasonable to conclude that most states do not collect enough data about work zones on their crash report forms to fully analyze work zone-involvement in crashes. This is clearly the case in Louisiana, in which the primary data indicator of a “work zone crash” is a check box called “Work Zone.” One of the most important findings from this research is that work zone crash reporting practices in Louisiana are inconsistent in several ways. First, according to the crash data analysis, 1910 crashes were identified as having taken place within the actual work zone boundaries, i.e., after the first orange warning sign was posted, while work zone signs were officially in-place; however, officer reporting only captured 104, accounting for only 5.5% of crashes occurring within the physical boundaries of work zones. Second, some crashes that were reported as work zone crashes were actually located outside of the project boundaries. This observation is inconsistent with the instructions stated in the Louisiana crash report guide. Third, a content analysis of the accessible population of crash report narratives (N=2723) indicated that only 3% contained an explicit mention of the work zone in their description, but slow/stop conditions were explicitly contained in 49% of narratives and congestion/backups were explicitly contained in 23%. In addition to assessing the overall data quality of work zone crash reporting in Louisiana, this report provides several recommendations to improve reporting of work zone crashes and work zone related crashes.","description":"This project reviews current work zone crash reporting practices in the US, specifically in Louisiana.

Notably, the extremely high crash rate immediately after licensure and the prolonged period of risk, particularly among young novices, are problems of international concern. Analyses comparing crash rates of novices with those of experienced adults have invariably demonstrated extreme disparities, with rates among novices that are higher and more variable, and which maintain for years after licensure. Young age at licensure seems to exacerbate the problem, but inexperience, regardless of age, is a fundamental factor. Not surprisingly, the amount of experience needed by novices to develop safe driving skills and good judgement is substantial; added to this, some novices require more experience than others, which is consistent with the way that carrying out any complex psychomotor task is learnt. According to every available measure, including crashes, risky driving and driving errors, improvements in driving performance occur gradually and unevenly over time. This has been described as the ‘young driver problem’: novices require substantial independent driving experience to become safe drivers, but the more they drive as novices the greater the associated risk. In most Western countries, at least, considerable attention is being paid to this problem, giving rise to initiatives in the spheres of education, training, testing, licensing, supervision and monitoring of novice young drivers. Despite their considerable potential, the protective benefits of these policies and programmes have not been well demonstrated, with the possible exception of graduated driver licensing. Despite improvements in their vehicle management skills after professional training, supervised practice and road testing, novices do not suddenly become safe drivers overnight. While there is already a wide range of available programmes, activities and policies in existence, and even though these measures are administered by highly motivated professionals, the effectiveness of driving safety programmes could still be improved by gaining a greater understanding of, and attention to, the mechanisms by which novices learn to drive safely.","description":"The paper examines the persistent safety challenges faced by young novice drivers, highlighting the exceptionally high crash rates immediately after licensure and the extended period of elevated risk that can last for years. It contrasts crash statistics of novices with those of experienced adults, underscoring the greater variability and severity among young drivers. The authors argue that inexperience, rather than age alone, is the fundamental driver of unsafe behavior, and that acquiring safe driving skills requires substantial, unevenly distributed practice. The phenomenon is framed as the ‘young driver problem’, where increased driving exposure paradoxically raises risk until sufficient competence is achieved. The discussion reviews current Western initiatives—education, training, testing, licensing, supervision, and monitoring—yet notes that their protective benefits remain largely unproven, with graduated driver licensing as a possible exception. The paper calls for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which novices learn to drive safely to enhance program effectiveness.","objective":"The study aims to critically assess the effectiveness of existing safety programmes and policies targeting novice young drivers. It seeks to identify why crash rates remain high despite widespread interventions in education, training, licensing, and supervision. By comparing crash data and performance measures across novice and experienced drivers, the authors intend to isolate the key factors contributing to persistent risk. The paper also aims to highlight gaps in evidence regarding the protective benefits of current initiatives, particularly outside graduated driver licensing. Ultimately, it proposes that a better grasp of the learning mechanisms underlying safe driving could inform more effective safety strategies for young drivers.","method":"The authors conduct a comparative analysis of crash rates, risky driving behaviors, and driving errors between novice and experienced adult drivers, drawing on available statistical measures.

As with reports on other topics, ETSC found a very mixed picture across different countries. Unfortunately, the available data do not give the full picture. Underreporting of deaths and injuries is a particular problem for pedestrians and especially cyclists. When a lone cyclist falls off a bike and dies or is seriously injured, the police may not be called, and the death may not show up in the main national road death statistics. In addition, when a pedestrian falls down and is injured or dies while walking on a footway or carriageway, these injuries or deaths are not currently considered as road casualties. It is also difficult to get data on the amount of walking and cycling in order to give figures for the numbers of deaths and injuries per km travelled or time spent. It is easy to achieve zero cyclist deaths when no-one feels safe enough to ride a bike. Despite these limitations, it is possible to see the kinds of policies that are working, and there are examples from national experts throughout the report. As always, the Safe System approach requires a combination of safe infrastructure, safe speeds, safe road users and good quality emergency response. But incremental changes will not be enough. For a serious shift to walking and cycling, particularly for local journeys in densely populated areas, the very design of urban spaces will need to change. Motorised traffic will need to slow down when it comes into spaces used by vulnerable road users; separated infrastructure and smart intersection design will be essential; school streets without cars may need to become the norm.","description":"This report examines the safety levels of cycling and walking in Europe, highlighting a mixed picture across different countries.

Results of the bridge consumption analysis are given in $/miles. To calculate pavement damage cost, life cycle cost and damage analysis were rendered for 37 different representative road segments in Florida. The pavement damage was presented based on the equivalent single axle loads (ESALs). Then, a model was developed to estimate the average pavement damage for a given number of ESALs. The pavement and bridge damage costs were combined and presented in the same format as the existing overweight permit fee structure. Comparing the proposed permit fee to the current Florida fees showed that the proposed fees will increase the revenues of single-trip permits by a factor of 1.6, multi-trip 12-month months permits by a factor of 1.5, and multi-trip 3-month permits by a factor of 2.7. This is based on a 90% discount for multi-trip permits. The department can choose an appropriate discount rate for multi-trip permits based on economic considerations.

The limousine, occupied by a 53-year-old driver and 17 passengers, was descending a downhill grade that began about 1.81 miles north of a T-intersection with New York State Route 30A (NY-30A). The posted speed limit was 55 mph. Although the driver likely applied the brakes while descending the hill, the brake system failed to effectively slow the limousine down the grade, and the vehicle’s speed increased to over 100 mph. The driver steered the vehicle over the double pavement striping to avoid a car stopped at the NY-30/NY-30A intersection, proceeded past a stop sign, crossed the intersection, and entered the driveway of a restaurant parking lot. The limousine struck an unoccupied 2015 Toyota Highlander sport utility vehicle (SUV) that was parked in a grassy field adjacent to the driveway. Two pedestrians who were standing near the SUV were struck by it when the SUV was forced forward by the limousine. The limousine continued across the edge of the driveway and into a ravine, where it struck an earthen embankment and several trees. As a result of the crash, 20 people died, including all 18 limousine occupants and the 2 pedestrians.  ​The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the Schoharie, New York, crash was Prestige Limousine and Chauffeur Service’s egregious disregard for safety, in dispatching a stretch limousine with an out-of-service order for a passenger charter trip, resulting in the failure of its brake system while descending the steep grade of New York State Route 30. Contributing to the crash was the New York State Department of Transportation’s ineffective oversight of Prestige Limousine, despite its knowledge of the carrier’s multiple out-of-service violations and lack of operating authority, as well as the department’s inadequate repair verification process.

California ACT finalizes standards that were first proposed in 2019 and strengthened in 2020. The regulation is the first of its kind worldwide to require vehicle   manufacturers to sell increasing percentages of zero-emission trucks, and is expected to reduce greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, eliminate tailpipe emissions, and stimulate a market for zero-emission HDTs. California comprises a large part of the HDT market in the United States, so ACT will produce effects beyond the state’s borders. The truck brands that represent the majority of sales in California also sell around the world. As manufacturers seek to disperse their research and development costs by introducing similar technology across different markets, ACT is expected to accelerate the spread of zero-emission HDTs across North America and the rest of the world. ACT is one of a series of rules aiming to advance climate mitigation and air quality management in California, requiring GHG reductions of 40% below the 1990 level in the state by 2030. ACT’s sales requirements are complemented by a series of requirements for fleet purchase, such as the Clean Transit rule for buses, coming into effect in 2023, that requires purchases of 100% zero emission buses by 2029.

Therefore, the combination of VR and wearable sensors provides an opportunity for researchers to study the optimal configuration for sending notifications to workers. This research first identified the key factors of a work zone that can influence the possibility of incidents as: work zone location, work duration and work type. Next, three work zone scenarios that are more likely to result in work zone incidents were identified based on a thorough literature review and screening of past news stories regarding worker injuries at work zones. Three scenarios based on real incidents were identified as more likely to lead to work zone incidents, including (1) setting up barriers to define a work zone perimeter that is close to an urban intersection; (2) striping/marking a road on an urban highway; and (3) installation of traffic sensors on the side of an urban highway. Finally, the authors proposed an integrated approach utilizing VR and wearable sensors to determine when, how, and at what frequency to push alarms to workers at work zones based on the physiological states of workers collected from the wearable sensors and workers’ behavior towards the alarms when they are in dangerous situations in VR. The approach is composed of four steps as: (1) recreating real-world work zones in VR, (2) enabling interactions in VR for construction activities, (3) conducting traffic simulation to obtain realistic traffic patterns near work zones and embedding vehicle movements in VR, and (4) developing a smartwatch application to send safety alarms and monitoring workers’ responses as well as their physiological states using wearable sensors.","description":"This research aims to increase work zone safety by analyzing worker behavior and integrating wearable sensors and virtual reality.

Areas can connect compact developments through high-quality transportation options, creating a network of centers, or a “polycentric” region.

The study gathered information on crosswalk lighting treatments, existing national guidelines for lighting at pedestrian crossings, and safety effectiveness of pedestrian crosswalks lighting. Reducing pedestrian crashes remains a major challenge in the United States. Pedestrian fatalities have been on the rise in the last 10 years, reaching approximately 6,000 fatalities in 2017, which accounted for 16 percent of all traffic fatalities. Among these pedestrian fatalities, about 75 percent occurred in dark conditions. The high number of crashes during dark conditions advocates for prioritizing lighting countermeasures to improve crosswalks visibility and pedestrian safety. This literature review identified overhead lighting, in-road flashing lights, and bollard level lights as the most used crosswalk lighting treatments. For crosswalk lighting and the amount of light needed to detect pedestrians crossing during nighttime, transportation agencies should consider, wherever feasible, providing adequate lighting at pedestrian crossings, especially where nighttime pedestrian volumes are high. Existing national guidelines recommend the light source to be located at least 10 ft. in front of the crosswalks, a vertical illuminance of 20 lux measured at a height of 5 ft. above the road surface, and street lights to be placed on both sides of the roadway. The review revealed a small number of studies that investigated pedestrian safety with respect to crosswalk lighting. These studies were grouped in three categories: behavioral, modeling, and crash studies. The behavioral studies showed, in general, enhanced lighting at crosswalks led to an improvement in drivers’ awareness and yielding to pedestrians, an increase in pedestrian observational behavior, and an increase in the car stopping distance before crosswalks. The modeling studies showed that providing street lighting is associated with lower probabilities of pedestrian fatalities and severe injuries. Crash studies found that providing adequate lighting at intersections helps to reduce the frequency of nighttime crashes and increase safety. Although there is evidence that crosswalk lighting, especially intersection lighting, has a positive impact on nighttime crashes, it is the researchers’ conclusion that extensive before-after studies are needed to investigate the safety effects of crosswalks lighting on pedestrian crashes and visibility as well as to develop appropriate crash modification factors. A survey is also recommended to collect information from states or municipalities that may have implemented such countermeasures.","description":"This study conducted a nationwide literature review to assess the relationship between lighting conditions and pedestrian crashes, focusing on crosswalk lighting treatments.

Consequently, Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) wants to know how a tree canopy affects pavement condition and road safety. A review of published research conducted for Phase I of this study suggested that tree canopies extend the life of asphalt pavement and improve road safety. Road managers and highway officials said roadside trees were believed to negatively impact the pavement surface directly below the canopy, according to the report’s survey and anecdotal accounts. These impacts included increases in moisture and temperature variation, reductions of pavement longevity, and undermined road safety. These observations have not been rigorously verified, and there is a lack of prior research on the topic. This study seeks to determine if tree canopies affect asphalt pavement in Ohio, quantify any effects, and recommend best management practices. The research was approached with controlled experiments on small plots concerning microclimate and pavement condition and observations and measurements on in-service pavements covering microclimate, pavement condition, and safety. The net results show tree canopies substantially reduce thermal loading, snow accumulation, and moisture in light to moderate rainstorms. Canopies also increase the persistence of moisture on stretches of shaded pavement. Snow and ice persistence were controlled by drainage and compaction by traffic, rather than the presence of tree canopies. In addition, a negative relationship exists between pavement surface texture and tree cover, landscape position, and traffic loading, but the effects on surface texture were apparent only under unusual conditions. No significant effects on pavement cracking were found. Crash data showed improvements in safety that can be attributed to roadside maintenance activities (trimming and pruning), but not specifically to the removal of tree canopy. There were no conclusive effects to driving behavior that can be related to tree canopy cover. Consequently, this report concludes that neither pavement condition nor driving behavior should be considered sufficient justification for removal or pruning of tree canopies as a form of routine maintenance on Ohio’s rural roadways.","description":"This study investigates the effects of tree canopies on pavement condition and safety in Ohio's rural highways.

There is little research on assessing safety of intersections on horizontal curves. Thus, this project’s goal was to quantitatively investigate safety of intersections on curves, specifically the Two-Way Stop-Controlled (TWSC) intersections. The analysis results show that clearly there is a safety problem associated with intersections placed on horizontal curves and the magnitude of the problem depends on the AADT, curve radius, intersection skewness angle, number of intersection legs and speed limit on major road. The single-vehicle crashes are the most common type of crashes on curve intersections, particularly on rural two-lane highway. Using the risk analysis process developed to facilitate the systemic safety approach, the project develops the ranking models for TWSC intersection on curves. With the rich data created by this project, the safety performance models for TWSC intersections on rural and urban two-lane highways are developed, which includes AADT, curve radius, and intersection skewness as independent variables.

In 2019, a total of 36,096 people were killed on U.S roadways. A total of 846 (2.3%) of these fatalities were bicyclists and around 75% of the bicycle fatalities occur in urban areas and intersections are common locations of crashes. Many bicycle enhancements such as bike boxes, bicycle signals, curb extensions have been installed to improve safety at signalized intersections. The City of Portland, Oregon experimented with an innovative treatment to improve bicycle crossings at unsignalized crossings. This treatment, termed a high visibility cross-bike, was installed at crossings of neighborhood bicycle greenways with busy roadways. The marking is similar way to a continental pedestrian crosswalk but with green pavement markings rather than white. Although the cross-bike marking does not currently require motorists to yield for bicycles waiting to cross the roadway, it was hypothesized that the presence of the marking would alter motorists yielding behavior towards bicyclists and improve the crossing experience for persons on bicycles. This thesis analyzed empirical data to evaluate the modifications in the rate of motorists yielding behavior at three unsignalized intersections in Portland, Oregon. Three intersections (NE Going and NE 15th Ave, SE Salmon and SE 20th Ave, NE Holman and NE 33rd) were evaluated in before and after experiment. A total of 48 hours of video data was analyzed to produce a sample of 1,840 bicycle crossing events (897 before; 943 after) carried out by 2,219 bicyclists. (1,097 before; 1,122 after). The rates of motorists yielding to bicyclists improved after installing cross-bike markings. The yielding rates at NE Going and NE 15th Ave increased from 48% near side to 91% near side and 61 % far side to 95% far side after the markings. SE Salmon and SE 20th Ave also realized a significant increase in motorists yielding rates from 21% to 40% near side and 11% to 33% far side. Trends were similar at NE Holman and NE 33rd with rates improving from 38% to 77% near side and 36% to 82% far side. The changes in driver yielding behavior were all  4 statistically significant. A reduction in bicyclists’ wait times at the locations was also observed.

An advantageous tool to be used in such studies is the Virtual Reality (VR) technology, as it provides a safe and highly realistic environment for performing behavioral experiments without endangering the participants. However, researchers still face the challenge of integrating real-world traffic data and interactions in VR back to simulation environments. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) is a testing paradigm where physical sensors (e.g., work zone traffic/worker monitoring sensors, worker notification sensors) are connected to a virtual test system that simulates reality (e.g., virtual work zone with simulated dangerous situations). This study presents the development of an integrated platform that allows a two-way interface between traffic simulation and VR environments. The integrated platform enables both applications to spontaneously interact with each other to represent realistic traffic and work zone conditions in the VR environment. The main contribution of this study is the development of the integrated and immersive platform and its customized API tool, called Traffic Simulation-Virtual Reality Integration (TSVRI). The TSVRI API, which bidirectionally transfers information between simulation and VR in real-time, guarantees that the VR environment represents the dynamic characteristics of the work zone traffic and user interactions are fed back to the simulation model to continuously update the traffic information. The integrated platform was tested in alpha experiments and shown to be effective to reproduce realistic traffic scenarios, scalable to different work zone settings (long-, intermediate-, short-term, or mobile), and is ready to be used in experiments with a higher number of participants with different construction experience.","description":"This study addresses persistent crashes in horizontal construction work zones by developing a novel integrated platform that combines virtual reality and hardware-in-the-loop testing.

City planners and decision-makers have begun to incorporate the needs of cyclists when building infrastructures. However, factors like annual average daily bicycle volume (AADB) and cycling injury risk should be taken into consideration during the planning. As technology develops, cost-effective crowdsourced bicycle data and traditional bicycle count data from permanent continuous count stations are useful tools in investigating the bicycle volume and determining injury risk to cyclists. This research project used bicycle count data from permanent continuous counters and data from a smartphone application (i.e., Strava). Upon installation, a permanent continuous bicycle or pedestrian counter undergoes validation to determine a correction factor. This factor accounts for systematic equipment error including false positive bicycle counts that are attributed to motor vehicles and natural occlusions of a pedestrian sensor when a pair of pedestrians walk side-by-side, among other possible errors. The research team analyzed the validation and correction factor calculation methodology used in the North Carolina Non-Motorized Volume Data Program (NC NMVDP) by examining the impacts of rounding on corrected count data, appropriate temporal aggregations for applying linear correction factors, the minimum number of non-zero observations required to properly calibrate an Eco-Counter system, differences between the magnitude of correction factors as calculated using historic programmatic processes and those calculated with linear regression methods, and methods for accounting for accuracy, tolerance, and uncertainty in count data recorded by an Eco-Counter system. The research team also developed a bicycle volume prediction model based on both the corrected bicycle count data recorded by the permanent continuous count stations in the NC NMVDP and crowdsourced bicycle data from the smartphone applications. The research team also generated a ridership map according to the prediction results. In addition, the cyclist crash data were integrated with the crowdsourced bicycle data using ArcGIS software. Locations with high crash risks were identified and injury risk models were developed. Important factors that affect crash risks are selected and discussed.","description":"This study focuses on improving bicycle volume measurement and injury risk assessment in North Carolina.

The study explored several high-priority research topics in safety data and analysis, including pedestrian crash analysis, probe data integration and analysis, and geospatial HSIS data integration. The project team developed a pedestrian count model to predict pedestrian volumes at locations without pedestrian counts and integrated speed information from probe data to supplement other roadway and contextual transportation data from several agencies.

In addition to the impact on air quality and public health, black carbon from diesel exhaust contributes to climate warming. The authors assess health and climate impacts of projected heavy duty vehicle (HDV) diesel exhaust emissions in Group of Twenty (G20) countries under four possibilities: 1) current policies; 2) expanded adoption of Euro VI or similar standards; 3) possible new emission standards; and 4) faster programs for vehicle fleet renewal. Wider implementation of world-class standards in G20 economies in 2023–2025 would reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) by up to 85% over the next twenty years, and in G20 countries adopting these standards, black carbon emissions could fall by nearly 99% over the same period. Also crucial to reducing NOx emissions from HDVs are next-generation standards. These new standards could reduce NOx emissions by almost 95% by 2040, compared with the 40%-80% expected under Euro VI or equivalent standards. Implementation of new standards in G20 economies could also save over $5 trillion of health damages over the next thirty years. These benefits would also apply to countries planning to implement Euro VI-equivalent standards in the near future. New standards coupled with accelerated fleet renewal policies would achieve the greatest benefits to the environment and public health. Avoided premature deaths attributable to diesel HDV emissions in G20 countries from 2020 to 2050 would total 4 million under a next-generation with 16-year fleet renewal scenario, which is four times the number under the expanded world-class plus 16-year renewal scenario. In European Union nations, policies for accelerated fleet renewal coupled with next-generation standards are expected to achieve at least twice the economic health benefits than either Euro VI standards or fleet renewal alone. Policies for next-generation emissions standards, combined with speedier fleet renewal, are expected to yield $6.8 trillion of economic health benefits between 2020 and 2050.","description":"The study assesses the air quality and health impacts of heavy-duty vehicles in G20 economies.

Among different fall types, the sideways fall is considered to be more severe concerning the injury outcome. When elderlies experience an unintentional sideways fall, they can either resist the impact forces with the soft tissue force attenuation capacity and femoral strength or need external protections to reduce the injury risk. In this project, these two aspects were investigated. finite element whole-body models are valuable instruments for analyzing the fall biomechanics and investigating the possible preventive measures more conveniently. The whole-body models were developed to investigate the traffic accidents; however, a sideways fall has different kinematics than the other types of accidents. Consequently, it is necessary to enhance the whole-body models according to the major fall parameters, leading to severe injury cases, before assessing the external protection capabilities. The current project attempted to advance these two critical aspects regarding the fall induced injuries. A finite element whole-body model was chosen to study three critical parameters in the fall biomechanics: body posture, soft tissue, femoral strength. In the second aspect of the project, the shock-absorbing rubberized asphalt pavements' preventive capacity was examined. first, different rubberized asphalt mixtures were implemented in bicycle and pedestrian accident reconstructions to evaluate the head injury risks.

Applications of Smart Work Zone (SWZ) systems, which are efficient in traffic management and safe for traffic, workers, and pedestrians, have received significant attention in Florida and other states. This study conducted a pilot implementation of SWZs to evaluate the effectiveness of deploying Active Work Zone Awareness Devices (AWADs), connected vehicle technologies via iCone products, stationary police vehicles with flashing blue lights, and their combinations in improving WZ safety on arterials, considering three stationary WZ types: lane closure, lane shift, and work on shoulder or median. This research focused major efforts to evaluate the effectiveness of AWAD deployment and its combinations with other applications. AWADs employ radar combined with flashing Light-Emitting Diode (LED) signs that warn drivers of an upcoming active WZ for arterial roads. These devices indicate travel speed and display safety signage of “Active Work Zone When Flashing” and “Speeding Fines Doubled.” In this project, vehicle speed data and driving behavior data were collected at seven study sites in Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) District 7 that cover various WZ types, roadway classifications, and traffic conditions. Statistical analyses were applied to compare safety performance, including vehicle speeds, sudden deceleration behaviors, and sudden lane change behaviors between deployments of SWZs under different scenarios and their baseline conditions (without SWZ deployments). Significant results of the research at seven pilot implementation sites included decreasing speeds entering arterial WZs by 10%, increasing safe driving behavior by 44%, and reducing risky driving by 43% by deploying AWADs alone. By combining AWAD deployments with the presence of law enforcement, more reductions in vehicle speeds and risky behaviors were achieved. For iCone products using Connected Vehicle (CV) technology to communicate WZ conditions or warnings with road users, it is anticipated to have an impact on reducing vehicle speeds approaching a WZ if a WZ message can be displayed and/or broadcasted automatically via WAZE and other navigation systems in the future.","description":"This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of deploying Active Work Zone Awareness Devices (AWADs) and connected vehicle technologies via iCone products in improving work zone safety on arterials.

The time needed for achievement of TCO parity between zero-emission trucks and diesel trucks in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen is estimated, providing an analytical basis to support the development of neighborhood electric vehicle (NEV) targets for the three HDV types. The analysis is based on modeling of TCO and simulation of energy consumption, and the authors intend it as a contribution to the Chinese government’s goal of increasing NEV sales to about 20% of all vehicles sold in 2025. The authors find that all BETs can achieve TCO parity with diesel trucks by the second half of the 2020s.

The authors make several recommendations for policies towards the adoption of HD-NEVs in China: 1) Ambitious near-term sales requirements for HD-NEVs should be set. Trucking operators will gain economic benefits from HD-NEVs only if there is a sufficient supply of vehicles; 2) Long-term zero-emission sales targets to help manufacturers with product planning and investment should be set; 3) Incentives to enable TCO parity of HD-NEVs with diesel in the first half of this decade should be provided; 4)  Application-specific but technology-neutral policies should be designed. Policies must deploy zero-emission vehicles in the segments with the highest carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, such as tractor-trailers, and should also aim for a level field between BETs and FCTs to favor the most cost-effective technologies in the longer term.

They have a significant impact on traffic conditions and the mobility of roadway systems. The traffic impacts of work zones could significantly vary due to several interacting factors such as work zone factors (work zone location and layout, length of the closure, work zone speed, intensity, and daily active hours); traffic factors (percentage of heavy vehicles, highway speed limit, capacity, mobility, flow, density, congestion, and occupancy); road factors (number of total lanes, number of open lanes, and pavement grade and condition); temporal factors (e.g., year, season, month, weekday, daytime, and darkness); weather conditions (rainy, sunny, and snowy); and spatial factors (road lane width, proximity, and number of ramps). Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) is continuously collecting and storing project-related data. Due to the significant impact of work zones on traffic conditions, they are interested in evaluating the impacts of work zone attributes on mobility and traffic conditions of roadway systems within the state of Utah. Such an analysis will help the UDOT personnel better understand and plan for more efficient work zone operations, select the most effective traffic management systems for work zones, and assess the hidden costs of construction operations at work zones. To help UDOT address this problem, the authors propose a robust, deep neural network (DNN) model capable of evaluating the impacts of the factors mentioned earlier on the mobility conditions of Utah roadway systems. DNNs can capture all the relationships between input variables and output compared to traditional machine learning algorithms. The results of this project show that work zone features have an important effect on the traffic condition. In the end, the performance of the model is evaluated using three different measures, including coefficient of determination (R²) score, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean squared error (MAE). Comparing the measurement to previously conducted research, it is the first study that has attempted to investigate the effect of work zone features on hourly traffic volume.","description":"Construction work zones are unavoidable in roadway operations and can significantly alter traffic conditions and mobility.

The aim of this study was to analyze young driver crash contributing factors and evaluate the Louisiana’s GDL program. Based on a comprehensive literature review, a wide array of crash attributes was identified as potentially influential. A Multinomial Logit (MNL) model was developed to analyze crash contributing factors to indicate their relative crash likelihood among young driver age groups. Several Mann-Kendall (M-K) tests have been performed to detect and quantify the gradual trend of young driver crashes. These crash trends have also been visualized by Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA) method to supplement the M-K test results. To quantitatively assess the impacts of GDL policy changes on young driver crash and consequential casualties, a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Explanatory Variables (SARIMAX) method has been applied. In spatial analysis, an analytical approach using ArcGIS to find hotspots of young driver crashes has been performed following the exploration of young driver crashes within Louisiana’s nine safety coalitions. The results from the MNL model analysis on selected attributes using 5-year crash data derived several key insights on their potential linkup with crashes with three young driver groups at fault—novice teen (15-16 years), young teen (17-19 years), and young adult (20-24 years). Young driver groups are strongly associated with driving violations, use of electronic devices alongside cellphone, non-use of driver protection system, and nighttime driving. M-K tests and ITA plots on long term crash frequency data, disaggregated by month, showed substantial decrease in crashes and severities related to these young driver age groups and specific characteristics of underage alcohol intoxication, cellphone use, non-usage of restraints. Time series analyses on GDL legislative policies indicated significant reductions in crash and associated casualties due to GDL implementation except for young adult driver groups. Spatial clusters of young driver crashes showed that they are highly concentrated in urban areas. The substantial decline of number of crashes and associated casualties involving young drivers suggests that implementation of the GDL program has been a success in Louisiana. This study provides a foundation to further explore specific crash patterns and trends, develop a statewide GDL curriculum, and evaluate the safety effectiveness of countermeasures for the improvement of young driver safety.","description":"This study aimed to understand the contributing factors to young driver crashes in Louisiana and evaluate the effectiveness of the Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) program.

Between 2009 and 2019, the number of pedestrian deaths increased 51%, from 4,109 to 6,205. The majority of these deaths (82%) occurred in urban areas. In a previous project (Phase 1 of this work), the authors engaged a diverse range of experts familiar with different aspects of pedestrian injury and death in the application of qualitative systems science tools to explore hypothesized and interconnected factors underlying the overall increase in pedestrian death rates. Detailed maps were created to depict these interconnections and clearly lay out the hypothesized mechanisms causing pedestrian death increases. The overall goal of this Phase 2 project was to develop a quantitative system dynamics simulation model that could be used as a learning tool to explore the pedestrian safety impacts of specific, current policy approaches in a defined U.S. setting. Given the recent focus and proposed implementation of congestion pricing policies (CPP) in the U.S. (and specifically in New York City), the authors chose to explore the pedestrian safety impacts of these policies, illustrating how system dynamics tools can be used to create virtual learning environments and explore potential system-wide effects of policies prior to implementation. To inform the model the authors also completed a bibliometric analysis of congestion pricing policy research broadly, as well as a detailed review of congestion pricing policy studies focused on safety impacts. These reviews and analyses illuminated several key gaps for future research consideration, including gaps in equity considerations of these policies, policy impacts on specific road user types (e.g., pedestrians, bicyclists), and safety impacts for all road users. The system dynamics model leveraged findings from these detailed reviews, as well as findings from Phase 1 of this work and a variety of data sources from New York City to examine potential congestion pricing policy impacts on pedestrian safety. The authors explored a variety of congestion pricing policy-related scenarios, examining differences in how such policies might be configured and revenue invested. While several of the policy scenarios resulted in similar congestion reductions, there was considerable variation in the pedestrian injury outcomes by scenario type. Some scenarios (e.g., scenarios that discontinued or reduced pedestrian infrastructure support or increased charges on for-hire vehicles) had deleterious effects on pedestrian injury counts, while others (e.g., scenarios investing a proportion of policy revenue in pedestrian infrastructure improvements pre- and/or post-policy implementation) offered improvements in pedestrian safety. A key policy take-away from this work is that a CPP combined with other pedestrian efforts has considerable potential for positive gains in public health.

In 2016, 764 fatalities occurred in WZs in the United States due to motor vehicle traffic crashes. A number of factors (aging highway infrastructure, increased road work, increased levels of traffic and more nighttime WZs) have led to an increase in WZ crashes in the past few years. The standard WZ safety signage and personal protective equipment worn by workers at roadside WZs have not been completely effective in controlling WZ crashes. This project aims to address this issue by designing a wearable device to accurately localize, monitor, and predict potential collisions between WZ actors based on their movements and activities, and communicate potential collisions to workers, passing drivers, and connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Through this project, a wearable worker localization and communication device (i.e., Smart Vest) was developed that utilizes the previously developed Threat Detection Algorithm to communicate workers’ locations to passing CAVs and proactively warn workers and passing motorists of potential collisions. As a result, this research is expected to significantly improve the safety conditions of roadside WZs through prompt detection and communication of hazardous situations to workers and drivers.","description":"Roadside work zones pose significant safety risks to both workers and motorists, with 764 fatalities reported in 2016 in the United States alone.

To capture all departure scenarios and take full advantage of crash data, the observed crash analysis includes not only conventional total crashes and targeted crashes, but also crashes with combined key crash attributes, as well as selected crash report reviews, which helps to the clarify the ambiguous or inconsistent information identified during the initial analysis. The biggest reductions come from fatal and severe injury crashes, which are 34% for rural two-lane and 45% for urban two-lane highways. The safety evaluations from multiple evaluation methods consistently demonstrate the success of rumble strips, particularly the centerline rumble strips installations. The before and after empirical Bayes (EB) analysis, comparison group EB analysis, with-and-without cross-sectional analysis, and ARIMA Intervention Model of trend analysis yield reliable crash modification factor (CMF) estimations for centerline rumble strips. The expected CMFs from before-after EB method are 0.845, 0.95, and 0.764 for CLRS, SRS, and combination of CLRS and SRS on rural two-lane highways, respectively. They are 0.677, 0.655, and 0.839 on urban two-lane highways, respectively. The huge economic benefits of rumble strips are manifest by the ratio of benefit to cost – 12.98 for combined all rumble strips cases on rural two-lane highways, and 14.64, 1.9, and 7.37 for the CLRS, SRS, and both (CLRS and SRS), respectively. The ratio is 37.2 for all rumble strips on urban two-lane highways, 38.27 for CLRS, and 83.55 for CLRS and SRS combined. This study demonstrates rumble strips as a low cost, effective crash countermeasure on two-lane highways. To reach the state’s goal of Destination Zero Deaths, rumble strips should be considered for installation along two-lane highways everywhere, if financially feasible, or if not, by prioritizing the installation projects based on either the crash frequency or crash risk at the network level.","description":"This study investigates the impact of center line rumble strips and shoulder rumble strips on all roadway departure crashes in Louisiana's two-lane highways.

Estimates of heavy-duty activity in the most recent version of the model at the time this work was conducted, MOVES2014, was identified as an area in need of improvement. The start activity in MOVES2014 is based on a limited and dated data set. In addition, MOVES2014 relies on drive cycles that represent on-network activity but do not account for idling activity that occurs on off-network roads, such as at a distribution center, while the truck is queuing or during loading and unloading. As a result, MOVES2014 likely underestimates idle activity for heavy-duty trucks in real-world operation. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has previously leveraged its expansive Fleet DNA database of heavy-duty vehicles to idle and start activity for six of the nine heavy-duty vehicle source types of classes in the MOVES model (EPA 2020b; Kotz and Kelly 2019). The data available in Fleet DNA from 416 conventional, diesel-powered vehicles provided activity estimates from more than 120,000 hours of operation throughout 14,682 vehicle days between October 2006 and January 2016. NREL calculated start fraction, starts per day, soak fraction, and idle fraction by hour of the day for each vehicle type, state, and vocation, and provided results in .CSV files that can be translated to MOVES table inputs. The idle and start activity from this initial analysis of Fleet DNA data was used to develop default idle and start data for heavy-duty vehicles in MOVES3 (EPA 2020b). To build on the results from the Fleet DNA data used for MOVES3, the EPA asked NREL to extend the previous start and idle analysis using additional data from a larger number of vehicles for a potential future update to the MOVES model. Such a data set was achieved from a project led by the University of California at Riverside, College of Engineering, Center for Environmental Research & Technology (CE-CERT) and funded by California Air Resources Board. Specifically, this data set consists of 90 heavy-duty vehicles operated mainly in California, which can be separated into five of the nine heavy-duty vehicle classes in the MOVES model. In addition, the heavy-duty activity database collected by CE-CERT provided activity estimates from more than 44,000 hours of operation throughout 4,724 vehicle days between November 2014 and September 2016. This report includes details about the analysis of the heavy-duty activity database collected from University of California at Riverside by providing graphical analysis and context for the start, and idle distributions.

Modern communications have delivered greater convenience. However, this has come at the cost of attention spans. Safety has been thoroughly explored in terms of distracted driving and pedestrians. However, impacts on traffic operations have received minimal research attention. Few studies provided a theoretical mechanism for affecting intersection operations but failed to quantify the real-life impacts on traffic operations. Furthermore, new Florida laws prohibit cellphone usage while driving but is allowed when the vehicle is stationary, which may result in increased cellphone use at red lights. This research aims to quantify how distracted driving and pedestrians impact vehicle headways at signalized intersections. Thousands of observations were collected from 21 approaches at 15 intersections in Central Florida, covering a variety of land uses, intersection configurations, and periods of high demand. The results demonstrated that the percentage of distracted drivers in the through and left movements were approximately 50% and 87%, respectively. Drivers were more distracted in commercial and tourist areas and less attentive to the signal changes than in school and residential areas. Almost third of the drivers were distracted by their cell phone for the through and left movements which had the primary effect on headway among distraction types with a 20% increase, which resulted in reducing the intersection capacity by 16.5%. Overall, the effect of distraction on the discharge headway at signalized intersections is significant. The base headway increased by 0.93 sec, which resulted in reducing the intersections’ capacity by 45.5%. The pedestrians’ analysis showed that around half the pedestrians were distracted. Pedestrians are less distracted in school and college land use than other land-use types.

At the same time, having a human safety operator in the vehicle jeopardises major anticipated benefits of HAVs – transport safety and efficiency.

Some environments are much clearer than others, for example a marked crosswalk versus an unmarked crosswalk. If there is a location where crashes between pedestrians and motorists occur often and for the same reason, then the local entity in charge will consider interventions to improve the design of the pedestrian crash hot-spot location. If engineers and planners can anticipate or know the response that the built environment activates in both motorists and pedestrians, then there is a reasonable chance at maximizing these safety improvements. Previous research on pedestrian control devices and their effect on pedestrian safety has shown that driver yielding compliance can improve by installing pedestrian signals at crossings, improving the visibility of pedestrians, providing education about pedestrian crossings, and reducing speed limits. Installing in-street signs in a gateway formation, which considered experimental use of the sign and requires MUTCD approval, has also shown to be as effective as expensive PHB and RRFB signs. The objective of this project is to determine how driver yielding compliance is affected by various combinations of low-cost crossing treatments and signage configurations. MUTCD provides guidance on pedestrian signs, beacons, pavement markings, for example, but guidance provided by the MUTCD regarding types of signs and particularly mounting locations for pedestrian crossing signs at non-signalized intersections is sparse. Specifications for mounting locations of warning signs and regulators signs leave lots of opportunity for engineering judgement. This study was as first step in defining the understanding the types of baseline yielding rates at four pedestrian crossing types and to understanding the impact of combination of signage type and crossing type have on driver yielding. When assuming no interaction between the R1-6 sign and crossing type, the effect of the sign is an +8% improvement on yielding compliance. When assuming interaction, the effect of the R1-6 sign depends on the crossing type. For concrete refuge islands, probability of yielding goes up by +50% ,which is 4x with the R1-6 sign. For flexpost islands, the sign improves yielding probability by an additional +4%, which doubles the probability. And at marked crosswalks, again compliance doubles by adding 3% to compliance probability with the sign. This study also found that high levels of pedestrian activity positively impact rates, and that high vehicle activity negatively impacted driver yielding rates at unmarked crosswalks.","description":"This study investigates the impact of low-cost crossing treatments and signage configurations on driver yielding compliance at non-signalized intersections.

First, a prototype autonomous shuttle system was expanded to include additional communication features in a lightbar as well as more advanced pedestrian detection systems. Secondly, multiple detection methods were trained and tested using traditional datasets as well as a new dataset including occluded pedestrians. Finally, a survey was conducted to determine how well pedestrians understand specific static or dynamic lightbar patterns as an additional communication tool for CAVs. This project tested multiple pedestrian detection methods and developed improved methods with increased accuracy and reduced latency. The EcoPRT vehicle was able to incorporate the improved detection method, however the training image set included multiple camera perspectives and the method could likely be applied to infrastructure-based detection systems. Additionally, the project developed a body part-based method which detects head, arms and legs of pedestrians in order to improve the overall detection of pedestrians when they are partially occluded. The project also developed a database of occluded pedestrian images which can be used for training or testing other new methods addressing this issue.

However, this control strategy generally causes adverse effects on other traffic, which limits its widespread adoption. Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have the ability to exchange traffic data and vehicle information in real-time with other vehicles and infrastructure in their vicinity, which can certainly facilitate the development of TSP control strategies. As a result, research on TSP combined with CAV technology has increasingly gained a lot of attention. This study evaluates the traffic performance of two general TSPCV control strategies, namely actuated TSP with CV (connected vehicle) and optimized TSP with CV, and compares them with two conventional signal control strategies, i.e., actuated signal control without TSP, and actuated signal control with TSP. Simulation experiments based on a signalized intersection in Charlotte, North Carolina, are conducted to compare the traffic performance of proposed control strategies under different market penetration rates, traffic demand, and bus arrival frequency conditions. Results indicate that the proposed Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization control strategy can reduce the average bus delay by 24.50% while minimizing the adverse impact on competing traffic under high traffic demand conditions. Fully actuated control with TSP using CV has the best performance in terms of average delay under low traffic demand conditions. In addition, the fully actuated with TSP using CV control strategy only requires the bus to be equipped with CV technology, which can be easily achieved due to its low cost. The proposed optimization control algorithm can provide certain priority to buses even at low rates of CV market penetration. The sensitivity analysis shows that the proposed optimization control algorithm is not very sensitive to either the bus occupancy or bus arrival frequency.

This is due largely in part to its positive impacts on environmental and socioeconomic sustainability of the surrounding area. However, it is crucial that city planners and transportation engineers provide facilities that are safe for these vulnerable road users. Surrounding land use and demographic factors may be associated with pedestrian compliance with a given traffic signal. This project seeks to create an understanding of how the surrounding land use and demographic characteristics of an intersection influence pedestrian compliance with a given crossing signal. This study uses pedestrian observation data collected from 145 crosswalks at 42 intersections in Connecticut. Pedestrians were recorded as being compliant if they crossed on the correct signal phasing and remained in the designated crosswalk for the entire crossing. The odds of compliance at each crosswalk are used as the response variable in a log-linear regression model which is being predicted by collected physical crosswalk site characteristics and geo-spatial data, including demographics and land use. The study analyzes three different buffer sizes for the geospatial data: half-mile, quarter-mile, and eighth-mile. The results from the study show that the quarter-mile land use buffer yielded the best model fit with all variables included being statistically significant at 95%. High density land use area, weighted population density, sidewalk presence, intersections with exclusive phasing, and day of the week all decrease the odds of pedestrian compliance with signal phasing. Medium density land use area, low density land use area, and crosswalk presence increase the odds of pedestrian compliance with signal phasing.","description":"This study aims to understand how surrounding land use and demographic characteristics of an intersection influence pedestrian compliance with a given crossing signal.

According to previous studies, cell phone use is one of the main sources of distraction while driving. The percentage of young drivers who never text and drive under any circumstances is very low. Therefore, the goal of this study is to educate the public about distracted driving and distraction prevention technologies, and to evaluate these technologies using a driving simulator. To reach this goal, a comprehensive study was conducted on all the technologies related to preventing distractions while driving. These technologies are divided into two main categories. The first category includes technologies that are designed to prevent distraction while driving (e.g., Do Not Disturb While Driving, Lifesaver, etc.). The second category consists of technologies that are designed to keep drivers safe when they are distracted while driving (Head-up Display, Lane Departure Warning Systems, etc.). The study also attempted to educate drivers about distracted driving using an online webinar. The online webinar was held on April 15, 2022. In the webinar, the research team discussed these two categories of distracted driving prevention technologies and distracted driving awareness with participants. The informative fact sheet was developed by the research team and distributed manually and online to Maryland drivers. To evaluate the distraction prevention technologies, the research team used a driving simulator that can replicate real-world traffic situations without endangering drivers. In this high-fidelity driving simulator drivers’ behaviors were examined while they used a cell phone blocking app. Some 35 participants drove in a simulated network under four scenarios (no distraction, texting, interacting with a cell phone, and driving with a cell phone blocking app). Participants also completed pre- and post-survey questionnaires. The results of this study support previous investigations regarding interactions with phones while driving. Results showed that drivers deviated from the center of the road, changed lanes significantly more often, and increased their steering velocity while interacting with a cell phone. The impact of cell phone blocking apps while driving was similar to the no distraction scenario while driving. This suggests that using cell phone blocking apps is one of the most effective ways to prevent distracted driving. Survey results indicated that 23% of drivers in the study used cell phone blocking apps before the experiment. However, 88% of the participants had a positive opinion about using cell phone blocking apps and indicated that they would use such apps. These findings support the importance of cell phone blocking apps from a policy perspective and highlight the need to educate drivers about distracted driving prevention technologies.","description":"The study aims to educate the public about distracted driving and evaluate distraction-prevention technologies.

One way of reducing the required capacity of the on-board energy storage is to enable the possibility to supply the vehicles with electrical energy while it is moving, also called dynamic charging. The energy transfer is usually achieved by either an inductive or conductive coupling between the static supply and moving vehicle. This thesis focuses on a conductive energy transfer system and the challenges that follows, mainly the preference that the supply and the on-board voltage system should be galvanically isolated. A prototype electrical powertrain is developed in a laboratory environment with the purpose of proving the concept as well as gathering measurement data for model validation. The data gathered is used to model three different types of electrical powertrains, each with a different philosophy with regard to galvanic isolation, and to compare their performance from an energy consumption and battery degradation point of view. The experimentally verified powertrain of this thesis features integrated energy transfer capabilities, meaning components originally only meant for traction purposes are also utilized in the process of transferring energy from an external supply to the wheels and energy storage on-board the vehicle. It turns out that this approach to energy transfer can be shown to be beneficial under certain circumstances, such as vehicle type, electric road characteristics for instance, compared to a separate energy transfer solution, where one separate component has, as its only purpose, the responsibility to transfer energy from a supply to the wheels and energy storage.","description":"This research focuses on developing an electric drive and charging system for heavy vehicles using electric road systems.

Traditional road users & AVs will be sharing the same urban space. The expected commencement of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has triggered intense research within the transportation community in recent years. The interaction between pedestrian and autonomous vehicles are challenging due to the complexity of their interaction process. While crossing a road, a pedestrian continuously checks for oncoming vehicles. Non-motorized users often rely on eye contact, hand motions, or audible dialogue with human drivers to accomplish roadway crossings. However, while crossing an intersection with autonomous vehicles, there is no driver with whom to interact. Human interaction and communication elimination with AV technology could influence unpredictable pedestrian behavior. Research shows that pedestrian-driver interaction at an intersection occurs with eye contact, facial expression, and hand gestures. Signs, like body movements and posture, influence pedestrian-driver communication. This implicit transaction decides who crosses the road first. The introduction of explicit communication with AV would be a big concern for traffic operations on a roadway. Therefore, mutual communication between the AV and pedestrians is important to understand pedestrian behavior. Currently, intensive research activities are being conducted on autonomous vehicle technologies; however, how an autonomous vehicle would interact with pedestrians is much less investigated. Hence, the study of autonomous vehicle interaction with pedestrians is crucial. This study investigates how a pedestrian would understand and respond to autonomous vehicles. This study aims to learn more about the expected behavior patterns and challenges experienced by pedestrians with AV technology. In addition, there is interest in learning about pedestrians' communication and interaction with AV. Psychophysical changes will be observed while interacting with AVs in a virtual reality setting to understand pedestrian attributes while crossing the roadway with this new technology. This insight into pedestrian behavior could be helpful to in designing technology for autonomous vehicles and making improvements to pedestrian infrastructure and traffic control technology. The effectiveness of a warning system and external features in the interaction of human-driven vehicles and pedestrians can also help the development of AVs.","description":"Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are expected to appear on public roads soon, sharing urban space with traditional road users. Pedestrian interaction with autonomous vehicles is complex because the usual human driver cues—eye contact, hand gestures, audible dialogue—are absent. This lack of interaction can lead to unpredictable pedestrian behavior when crossing roads or intersections. The study focuses on how pedestrians understand and respond to autonomous vehicles, emphasizing the need for mutual communication. Using a virtual reality environment, researchers observe psychophysical changes in pedestrians as they cross while interacting with AVs. Insights from this research aim to inform the design of AV technology, pedestrian infrastructure, and traffic control systems. The ultimate goal is to improve safety and operational efficiency in mixed traffic environments.","objective":"The study seeks to learn about expected pedestrian behavior patterns and the challenges they face when interacting with autonomous vehicles.

Innovations in wind energy resources will move California closer to achieving its goal. To gain a better understanding of transient pressure and the wind shear generated at the bridge poles from passing vehicles, this study performed large-eddy simulations of a vehicle (also called an Ahmed body) moving under a freeway overpass at a distance of 0.75 w (width) from the bridge poles. Results include transient contours of mean velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, vorticity, and pressure around the vehicle and at the bridge poles at different time steps. Additionally, results indicate the vehicle’s base pressure changes with time, indicating the impact of the poles' constraints on the vehicle's drag. On the bridge poles, the location of the stagnation point changes with the passing of the vehicle, and the poles experience a transient load, with the peak load associated with the passage of the vehicle's leading edge. The transient wind generated between the poles is mostly due to the vehicle’s front and decreases with the passing of the vehicle. The pressure at this location oscillates between a peak positive and a peak negative, generating a force potential for possible electric power generation. This data indicates the potential of capturing vehicle-generated wind energy for electric power generation, which could help California meet its clean energy goals and mitigate the negative impacts of climate change.","description":"This study uses large-eddy simulations to investigate the wind shear generated by passing vehicles under a freeway overpass.

However, due to limited visibility at night, it is well accepted that pedestrians are vulnerable during that time. Thus, the nature of crashes and the effect of lighting at night should be clearly understood. The primary objective of this study is three fold - to review lighting policies/guidelines/practices in Louisiana and other states, investigate the impact of lighting conditions on pedestrian crashes, and estimate the benefit of lighting over the cost of crashes. The collected lighting policies and guidelines show that the majority of the states and cities within the United States have similar pedestrian lighting or overall streetlight policies. A total of 8,149 pedestrian crash data from 2014 to 2018 was explored. The data showed a higher fatality rate between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. The majority of crashes occurred in urban areas; however, the fatality rate was higher in rural areas. Even in rural areas, most pedestrian fatalities occurred in dark areas without light. The statistical model at intersections and segments found that areas with low pedestrian visibility are more likely to have illumination. In addition, the data-mining model suggests that driver impairment and their physical condition (inattentive, distracted, illness, fatigued, asleep), specific pedestrian and driver age group (>64 years), and crashes occurred in locations such as interstate and open country that were associated with the daylight condition. At dark with or without lights, pedestrian alcohol/drug involvement, pedestrian walking with/against the traffic, and pedestrian dark clothing were detected as key factors leading to crashes. Additionally, pedestrians on high-speed roadways were found to be vulnerable to fatal crashes in dark lighting conditions. A Crash Modification Factor (CMF) from the clearinghouse website was used to conduct the cost-benefit analysis. It revealed a significant effect of lighting, especially in reducing fatal and severe pedestrian crashes. Overall, the result indicates the positive impact of lighting on pedestrian crashes at both intersections and segments.","description":"This study aims to investigate the relationship between lighting conditions and pedestrian crashes in Louisiana.

An accelerated worldwide transition to ZEVs could reduce road transportation carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions by 73% of 2020 levels by 2050. Transitions to heavy duty zero emission vehicles (HD ZEVs) represent about half of this potential for emissions reduction. Achieving this in the HDV sector would yield CO₂ emission reductions of 47.5 billion tonnes between 2020 and 2050. If the transportation sector is to fulfill its Paris Agreement emissions reduction obligations, the ZEV share of worldwide HDV sales must rise to 45% by 2030, and to nearly 100% by 2040. The necessary pace of transition varies across the various HDV segments, but greater ambition is required in segments such as buses, where zero-emission technology is now commercially available and cost-effective. A swift transition to zero-emission HDVs will bring immense health benefits worldwide. Among G20 countries, ensuring that new HDVs have ultra-low or zero emissions could prevent 3 million premature deaths worldwide through 2050, equivalent to 5 trillion United States dollars (USD) in health benefits. Projections of commercial availability and ownership costs show that 45% HD ZEV sales in 2030 and 100% sales in 2040 are realistic goals for Zero Emission Vehicles Transition Council (ZEVTC) countries. Urban buses, delivery vehicles and short-haul trucks are ready for early HD ZEV adoption, and can reach 100% sales by 2030 in ZEVTC countries. Effective national policies are needed to hasten uptake of HD ZEVs. Governments should set clear and legally binding HD ZEV sales targets that meet climate goals, and encourage greater ambition in vehicle segments with more advanced ZEV markets. HD ZEV sales of 45% by 2030 and 100% by 2040 would meet the Paris Agreement’s goals. Regulations should spur the uptake of zero-emission technology, requiring that manufacturers increase their production of HD ZEVs annually. Fiscal incentives such as purchase subsidies and tax deductions can lessen ownership costs and should be designed to close the gaps in costs among vehicle segments, while being regularly reviewed to match technological innovations and changes in costs. Governments can lead the development of infrastructure, ensuring that electrification targets are met, and should incentivize investment by the private sector while steering public sector investment to where it is most needed. Fleet purchase requirements can further spur the supply of HD ZEVs, and should be applied to public and private fleets of buses and trucks.","description":"The study examines the transition time needed for heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) to meet climate targets, the feasibility of this transition, and possible approaches for adoption of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) in different HDV segments.

Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland, have experienced a significant number of traffic accidents in recent years, with pedestrians being particularly vulnerable. Video surveillance has long been established as a valuable method for analyzing pedestrian behavior. However, traditional manual analysis of video footage is costly, time-consuming, and prone to human errors. With the advancement of computer vision and machine learning technologies, such as the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, it has become possible to automate and streamline the analysis process. In this study, the authors applied the YOLOv8 algorithm to analyze video surveillance footage, allowing for efficient extraction of pedestrian data and the development of analytics for pedestrian behavior at signalized intersections. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning tools, the authors were able to process large volumes of video footage and obtain detailed insights into pedestrian behavior at intersections. The application of computer vision and machine learning techniques, specifically the YOLOv8 algorithm, to analyze video surveillance footage has proven to be a valuable approach for studying pedestrian behavior at intersections in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland. This preliminary study presents a method for tracking pedestrians and compares pedestrian volume and speed across five intersections. By automating the analysis process, this study has provided comprehensive insights for using video footage to track pedestrian movements, contributing to the broader goal of improving pedestrian safety in urban environments.

Another crucial aspect is ensuring the comfort of active travellers, including the quality of pedestrian-SDV interactions. While SDVs may differ in a number of ways from HDVs (human-driven vehicles), the essential defining characteristic is that vehicle control is ceded from a human to a computer. This fundamental difference, along with other changes in vehicle operation or appearance, will likely influence perceptions of safety and comfort for active travellers. Pedestrian interactions with SDV are more complex and challenging than HDV interactions because, among other reasons, pedestrian-driver communications are disrupted. Pedestrians may find it more challenging to both communicate their intentions and infer the intentions of SDVs. Moreover, because perceptions of safety vary systematically across the population, introducing SDVs may disproportionally affect comfort for certain groups of people. The goal of this study is to inform strategies for the responsible introduction of SDVs in a way that does not degrade the walking experience. The authors seek to understand how a diverse and representative array of people perceive interactions between pedestrians and SDVs, in contrast to today’s HDVs, and how these perceptions relate to policy support for efforts to integrate and regulate SDVs.

Although walking trips have increased in the last decade, pedestrian safety remains a top concern. In 2020, 6,516 pedestrians were killed in traffic crashes, representing the most deaths since 1990 (NHTSA, 2020). Approximately 15% of these occurred at signalized intersections where a variety of modes converge, leading to the increased propensity of conflicts. Current signal timing and detection technologies are heavily biased towards vehicular traffic, often leading to higher delays and insufficient walk times for pedestrians, which could result in risky behaviors such as noncompliance. Current detection systems for pedestrians at signalized intersections consist primarily of push buttons. Limitations include the inability to provide feedback to the pedestrian that they have been detected, especially with older devices, and not being able to dynamically extend the walk times if the pedestrians fail to clear the crosswalk. Smart transportation systems play a vital role in enhancing mobility and safety and provide innovative techniques to connect pedestrians, vehicles, and infrastructure. Most research on smart and connected technologies is focused on vehicles; however, there is a critical need to harness the power of these technologies to study pedestrian behavior, as pedestrians are the most vulnerable users of the transportation system. While a few studies have used location technologies to detect pedestrians, this coverage is usually small and favors people with smartphones. However, the transportation system must consider a full spectrum of pedestrians and accommodate everyone. In this research, the investigators first review the previous studies on pedestrian behavior data and sensing technologies. Then the research team developed a pedestrian behavioral data collecting system based on the emerging LiDAR sensors. The system was deployed at two signalized intersections. Two studies were conducted: (a) pedestrian behaviors study at signalized intersections, analyzing the pedestrian waiting time before crossing, generalized perception-reaction time to WALK sign and crossing speed; and (b) a novel dynamic flashing yellow arrow (D-FYA) solution to separate permissive left-turn vehicles from concurrent crossing pedestrians. The results reveal that the pedestrian behaviors may have evolved compared with the recommended behaviors in the pedestrian facility design guideline (e.g., AASHTO’s “Green Book”). The D-FYA solution was also evaluated on the cabinet-in-the-loop simulation platform and the improvements were promising. The findings in this study will advance the body of knowledge on equitable traffic safety, especially for pedestrian safety in the future.","description":"The study aims to improve pedestrian safety by analyzing pedestrian behavior and developing innovative solutions using LiDAR sensors.

A common thread of these programs is that they are aspirational and there is not an expectation that zero fatalities will ever be a reality. While there are many contributors to fatal crashes, by far the biggest contributor is driver error. In South Carolina, the first contributing factor in nearly 85% of fatal crashes is driver related.

Every year, distracted driving costs lives. In the U.S., distracted driving claims the lives of nine people per day. With the increasing presence of Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV)  technologies, there is a corresponding rise in the quantity of auditory and visual notifications and warnings for drivers. Consequently, the need to examine the potential adverse impacts of these notifications on drivers is growing. The main goal of this project is to decrease the number of distracted driving crashes in Maryland by educating drivers and investigating different CAV technologies. To achieve this goal, an online webinar was conducted to educate drivers regarding distracted driving due to new CAV technologies, as well as how drivers can avoid distractions and crashes caused by distractions. The online webinar was held on April 28, 2023, with a total of 34 participants. In the webinar, the research team discussed all of the CAV technologies, warnings and notifications and their association with distracted driving. Moreover, a driving simulator and eye-tracking system was used to assess the effects of different CAV notification and warning modality types (auditory, visual, and bimodal) on drivers’ and gaze behaviors. Thirty-five participants wore eye trackers while driving in a simulated network across four scenarios. The participants also completed pre- and post-survey questionnaires. Based on the results of the ANOVA with a post-hoc test, there was a significant difference in throttle and steering velocity changes between scenarios. It suggests that when drivers were presented with a visual warning, their focus was diverted from the road, and as a result, they failed to adapt to the changing driving environment, resulting in rapid changes in the direction of the vehicle. The results of the eye tracker and heatmaps demonstrated that during the visual and bimodal warnings, participants’ gaze fixations were primarily focused on the CAV warnings rather than the road. The longer gaze fixation for visual warnings suggests that the presence of additional auditory cues in the bimodal scenario may have influenced participants to shift their attention more quickly between the warning and the road environment. Participants preferred bimodal alerts and acknowledged the positive influence of the CAV warning on their safety. The results emphasize the significance of combining several modalities to improve the effectiveness of CAV warnings.","description":"This study aims to reduce distracted driving crashes in Maryland by educating drivers and investigating the effects of Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) technologies on driver behavior.

The proposed method quantifies long-term safety probabilities, even in scenarios with limited samples from risky states or long-term trajectories. This is crucial for avoiding potentially hazardous situations without requiring extensive data. (2) Maximally Safe Actions: By focusing on the maximal safety probability, the method helps in selecting actions that are safe without being overly conservative. This reduces the likelihood of overly cautious behavior, which could impair the performance of autonomous driving systems in real-world, dynamic environments. (3) Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning (PIRL): The PIRL algorithm introduces physics constraints into the learning process, which enhances safety in complex and interactive environments. These constraints propagate risk information to neighboring states, allowing the system to infer risk in unsampled or rare states, enhancing the robustness of the driving system in uncertain situations. These methods will be useful for autonomous vehicles to make informed and safe decisions that minimizing risks while maximizing performance, even in environments with uncertain agents.","description":"This report proposes techniques for safe autonomous driving in uncertain and interactive environments.
