            <h1>About: Safe System Approach Countermeasure Selection Tool</h1>

            <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>

            <p>
              NCHRP Report 500: Guidance for Implementation of the AASHTO
              Strategic Highway Safety Plan identifies proven, tried, and
              experimental safety strategies for each of the emphasis areas in
              the American Association of State Highway and Transportation
              Officials’ (AASHTO’s) original 1998 Strategic Highway Safety Plan.
              The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and state departments of
              transportation (DOTs) partnered through a pooled fund study to
              develop reliable estimates of the effectiveness of the safety
              improvements identified as strategies in the NCHRP Report 500
              series.

              <br /><br />
              Information presented in the NCHRP Report 500 series predates the
              Safe System approach, which is an internationally adopted
              framework for road safety management that works by building and
              reinforcing multiple layers of protection to prevent crashes from
              happening in the first place and minimize the harm caused to those
              involved when crashes do occur
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://www.un.org/pga/76/wp-content/uploads/sites/101/2022/05/HLM-on-Road-Safety-Concept-note-Circulated.pdf"
                >(UN Resolution)</a
              >
              . An increasing number of localities and states are moving toward
              a Safe System approach in road planning, design, and operation. To
              assist transportation owners and operators, FHWA developed a
              series of guidance documents and associated tools outlining
              application to the Safe System in the U.S. context
              <a
                href="https://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/zerodeaths/docs/FHWA_SafeSystem_Brochure_V9_508_200717.pdf"
                target="_blank"
                >(FHWA Brochure)</a
              >
              . To further support this process, there is an immediate need to
              provide updated, evidence-based countermeasure information for
              priority crash types addressed in the NCHRP Report 500 series to
              reflect the current knowledge base.
            </p>

            <h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
            <p>
              The objective of this project is to develop a searchable
              electronic toolkit that builds on the NCHRP Report 500 series to
              align with Safe System principles and AASHTO’s current priorities,
              as well as reflect the most recent research and identify new
              innovations to help achieve the goal of zero deaths on the
              nation’s roads. Successful completion of this project will (1)
              help transportation officials consider a broader list of
              countermeasures applicable to the majority of crash types; (2)
              improve the efficiency of countermeasure selection, link to state
              analysis tools, and enhance usability of the NCHRP Report 500
              series; (3) provide access to the most current information; (4)
              advance implementation of the Safe System approach; and (5)
              increase practitioner awareness of the NCHRP Report 500 series.
